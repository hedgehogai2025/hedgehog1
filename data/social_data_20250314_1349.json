While the volatility favors day traders, long-term investors are always looking for stable assets that could guarantee profits in the long term. If you are a long-term investor, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) volatility has made it an unreliable source of crypto trading profits for you. However, despite the choppy market, a new crypto, FXGuys ($FXG), has emerged as a worthwhile investment option due to its features and perks that promise long-term growth. Here\u2019s why you should invest in the $FXG presale early to enjoy massive long-term gains! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Ethereum\u2019s Volatility Spurs an Investor Shift to FXGuys Ethereum\u2019s token has recorded huge price swings that have left investors seeking alternative investment options. In early March 2025, ETH plunged to the psychological $2,000 support, which is its 16-month low from November 2023. ETH\u2019s price was choppy, gaining 14% on March 2, 2025, and losing 15% the next day. The increased volatility followed President Trump\u2019s announcement of a U.S. crypto reserve, which includes Ethereum. But, the initial market excitement was short-lived. While the market dipped, a crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, said that ETH whales accumulated over $422 million worth of ETH in one day, citing data from Santiment. Meanwhile, ETH was valued at $2,196.84 on March 7, 2025, after a sloppy 3.47% price increase in the past week. Despite increased whale activity around Ethereum, investors are considering FXGuys as the smarter bet for long-term investment. FXGuys offers stability, same-day payouts, and trader rewards, unlike Ethereum\u2019s volatility-driven swings, making it the smarter, more reliable long-term investment option. FXGuys: The New Crypto Trading Platform Redefining Long-Term Investing There are multiple reasons why FXGuys is the most promising investment you can make in the crypto trading market currently.

Investors can access their money within 24 hours after withdrawing from the FX Guys platform. Additionally, the platform offers unlimited withdrawals, which means traders and investors can withdraw any amount they want without hiccups and restrictions.

As Robinhood adds Pengu (PENGU), Pnut (PNUT), and Popcat (POPCAT) to its platform to meet growing retail demand, CZ has pushed back against claims that he sought a presidential pardon from Donald Trump. CZ Denies Seeking Trump Pardon Amidst Wall Street Journal Allegations Changpeng \u201d CZ \u201d Zhao, the former CEO of Binance, has vehemently denied allegations that he had seeked a presidential pardon from US President Donald Trump. The claims, initially published in a March 13 report by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), suggested that CZ was exploring avenues for legal relief that could allow him to reassume an operational role at Binance or otherwise regain influence in the crypto industry. Zhao took to X shortly after the report's release to refute the claims, stating that he never discussed a business arrangement between the Trump family and Binance.US. He further denied that he had ever pursued a pardon from Trump, calling the report part of a broader political attack against the president and the cryptocurrency sector. \u201cNo felon would mind a pardon, especially being the only one in US history who was ever sentenced to prison for a single BSA [Bank Secrecy Act] charge,\u201d Zhao wrote. \u201cFeels like the article is motivated as an attack on the President and crypto, and the residual forces of the \u2018war on crypto\u2019 from the last administration are still at work.\u201d Zhao\u2019s legal troubles stem from a landmark case in which Binance reached a $4.3 billion settlement with US authorities in November 2023. As part of the agreement, Zhao pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) for failing to implement an effective anti-money laundering program at Binance. He subsequently stepped down as CEO and was sentenced to four months in prison. The plea deal also reportedly included a stipulation barring him from any operational or managerial role at Binance indefinitely. Despite serving his sentence, the implications of Zhao\u2019s conviction continue to be a focal point of scrutiny, particularly as the regulatory landscape for crypto shifts under the new administration. While a presidential pardon from Trump would not erase Zhao\u2019s conviction, it could potentially lift some of the legal restrictions imposed on him. According to the US Department of Justice, a pardon \u201dremoves legal disabilities imposed because of the conviction,\u201d meaning it could open the door for Zhao to resume certain professional activities within the cryptocurrency space. However, legal experts argue that a pardon\u2019s impact would likely be limited. The $4.3 billion settlement agreement with US authorities\u2014including the permanent injunction against Zhao\u2019s involvement in Binance\u2014may still hold, regardless of whether Trump grants him clemency. Additionally, such a move would likely face intense scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators who have sought to hold Binance accountable for its alleged past regulatory lapses. The Political and Regulatory Landscape: A Crypto Shift Under Trump? The WSJ report also speculated that Trump\u2019s administration has been taking a markedly different approach to cryptocurrency regulation. Since Trump took office in January, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reportedly paused multiple enforcement actions against major crypto firms, including some entities linked to those who supported his campaign or inauguration fund. One of the most notable examples is the SEC\u2019s decision to file for a 60-day pause in its legal battle with Binance, a move that followed the departure of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The shift in approach has sparked speculation that Trump\u2019s administration may be looking to ease regulatory pressures on the crypto industry. Additionally, reports suggest that the SEC may soon conclude its civil case against Ripple Labs, a long-running lawsuit that has been a defining legal battle for the crypto industry. If the SEC opts to drop its case against Ripple, it could set a precedent for further regulatory softening under Trump. While Zhao remains one of the most influential figures in the crypto world, his ability to directly participate in Binance\u2019s operations or any major crypto firm remains uncertain. Even if Trump were to grant him a pardon, Zhao would still face scrutiny from regulators and financial institutions wary of Binance\u2019s history of compliance issues. For Binance itself, the legal battles with US regulators remain a significant overhang. While the company has taken steps to improve its regulatory standing\u2014including leadership changes and compliance overhauls\u2014its future in the US market remains uncertain. Meanwhile, Zhao has hinted at a desire to remain involved in the industry in some capacity, even if not directly linked to Binance. His recent social media activity suggests that he remains deeply engaged with the broader crypto ecosystem and may seek alternative ways to contribute. Robinhood Expands Crypto Offerings with PENGU, PNUT, and POPCAT Listings Amid Rising Meme Coin Demand In other news, Robinhood has officially expanded its cryptocurrency offerings by listing three new meme coins\u2014Pengu (PENGU), Pnut (PNUT), and Popcat (POPCAT)\u2014as part of its aggressive push into the digital asset space. The latest listings signal a strategic shift by Robinhood, which is capitalizing on the growing retail interest in speculative crypto assets following US President Trump's election victory. As regulatory winds shift in favor of the crypto industry, exchanges are accelerating the addition of new digital assets, with meme coins emerging as a key battleground. Meme coins\u2014initially dismissed as mere internet jokes\u2014have evolved into a legitimate market force, attracting billions in trading volume. Dogecoin (DOGE), the sector's largest asset by market capitalization, has already been available on Robinhood, but the platform's latest expansion into lesser-known meme coins reflects a broader strategy to meet retail demand. The decision to list PENGU, PNUT, and POPCAT follows a February statement from Robinhood Crypto, which revealed a significant uptick in customer interest in meme coin trading. This customer-driven approach appears to be paying off, as Robinhood\u2019s crypto revenues soared 700% year-over-year in early 2024. Meme coins, often fueled by online communities and social media hype, have become a major driver of speculative trading activity, particularly among retail investors looking for short-term gains. Robinhood\u2019s Crypto Expansion and Competitive Strategy While Robinhood is traditionally known as a stock trading platform, the company has significantly ramped up its crypto-focused services over the past year. In January, it launched crypto futures trading, providing users with more advanced trading options beyond spot buying and selling. The brokerage\u2019s latest meme coin listings indicate a direct challenge to established crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Binance.US, both of which have rapidly expanded their token listings since Trump\u2019s election win. As crypto adoption grows, the competition among platforms to capture retail traders is intensifying, with meme coins acting as an entry point for many new investors. Robinhood\u2019s expansion into crypto has not only been strategic but also lucrative. The platform reported record-breaking trading volumes across equities, options, and cryptocurrencies in Q4 2024, with crypto trading seeing the highest percentage growth. A crucial factor in Robinhood\u2019s accelerated push into crypto is the changing regulatory landscape in the US. Under former SEC Chair Gensler, the agency took an aggressive stance against the crypto industry, arguing that most digital assets should be classified as securities and thus subject to strict regulation. However, following Trump\u2019s election and the appointment of crypto-friendly regulators, the SEC\u2019s stance on digital assets has softened considerably. In February 2024, the SEC made a landmark declaration, stating that most meme coins do not qualify as securities and, therefore, do not fall under its jurisdiction. This announcement was a stark reversal from the Biden administration\u2019s regulatory approach, which had imposed heavy enforcement actions on crypto exchanges and platforms. Additionally, the SEC dropped an enforcement action against Robinhood in February, which had alleged that the company\u2019s crypto trading platform violated securities laws. This decision further signaled a regulatory shift favoring innovation and crypto adoption, providing platforms like Robinhood with greater flexibility to list new assets without facing immediate legal scrutiny. With Robinhood continuing to expand its crypto services and token offerings, the platform is positioning itself as a major player in the evolving digital asset market. Meme coins, once viewed as a niche segment, are now attracting institutional attention and massive retail trading volume, with some tokens even outperforming traditional cryptocurrencies in certain market cycles. With Trump\u2019s administration signaling pro-crypto policies, the industry could see further regulatory easing, making it easier for platforms to list new assets without fear of legal action.", "published_on": "2025-03-14T13:30:00", "url": "https://coinpaper.com/7987/cz-refutes-wsj-report-on-trump-pardon-calls-it-politically-motivated", "source": "coinpaper", "categories": ["REGULATION", "EXCHANGE", "BNB", "TRADING", "MARKET"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.08345634329240889, "subjectivity": 0.42615706242755425, "sentiment": "neutral"}, "entities": ["ripple", "dogecoin"], "topics": ["trump", "meme", "pardon", "regulatory", "binance"]}, {"id": "41629008", "title": "Texas court issues judgment against Bancor DAO after it ignored summons", "body": "A Texas federal judge has entered a default judgment against Bancor DAO, which operated the decentralized finance platform Bancor, after it failed to respond to an online summons.

Meanwhile, the European Central Bank is struggling to gain public support for the digital euro, as consumers show little interest in adopting a central bank digital currency. In contrast, stablecoin adoption in Latin America is surging, with USDC and USDT becoming preferred financial tools due to high inflation and economic instability. Stablecoin Bill Faces Resistance from Bankers The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins ( GENIUS ) Act is facing resistance from US bankers and their allies in the Senate, who are concerned that stablecoins could disintermediate traditional financial institutions and erode their market share. According to an article from American Banker , the bill requires 60 votes to pass, which means that it needs support from at least seven Democratic senators alongside Republicans. This presents a bit of a challenge, as influential people like Senator Elizabeth Warren are still opposed to the legislation. Warren proposed an amendment that will prohibit tech firms from issuing stablecoins, and argued that only regulated financial institutions should have the ability to facilitate payments. She also warned that the bill disrupts the existing framework by allowing big tech and corporate entities to enter the stablecoin market. Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott, R-S.C., and committee ranking member Elizabeth Warren The rise of digital assets fundamentally altered financial dynamics by offering near-instant settlement times and much lower transaction fees. Stablecoins, in particular, demonstrated their ability to reduce the costs of cross-border payments and facilitate direct peer-to-peer transactions. The GENIUS Act was introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty on Feb. 4, and it seeks to provide a clear regulatory framework for stablecoin issuance and integration in the US financial system. The proposal attracted a lot of support from people like Federal Reserve Bank Governor Christopher Waller , who believes that non-bank entities should be allowed to issue stablecoins. Waller argues that stablecoins could enhance payment use cases, particularly in the developing world, by improving cost efficiency and accessibility. The potential benefits have not gone unnoticed in the banking sector either, with Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan recently revealing that the institution is exploring the possibility of launching its own stablecoin. Stablecoins are also getting recognition at the highest levels of government. During the first White House Crypto Summit on March 7, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pointed out that stablecoins could play a big role in maintaining US dollar dominance. Overcollateralized stablecoin issuers are now among the largest buyers of US government debt, ranking 18th globally and surpassing countries like Germany and South Korea in their purchases. Policymakers advocating for stablecoin adoption argue that by implementing supportive regulations and promoting the global use of stablecoins, the US government can leverage them as a financial tool to absorb inflationary pressures and reinforce the dollar\u2019s status as the world\u2019s reserve currency. However, the ongoing political battle over the GENIUS Act also proves that there is still a deep divide between traditional financial institutions looking to protect their market dominance and supporters of digital assets. ECB Struggles to Sell Digital Euro Meanwhile, European consumers have shown very little interest in adopting a central bank digital currency, which raised some concerns for the European Central Bank as it prepares for a potential rollout of the digital euro. A recent ECB working paper on consumer attitudes toward a central bank digital currency surveyed around 19,000 respondents across 11 euro-area countries, and it revealed major communication challenges that are discouraging European households from embracing the digital euro. When asked to hypothetically allocate 10,000 euros across different assets, Europeans allocated only a small portion to the digital euro. The March 12 ECB report found that Europeans strongly prefer existing payment methods and do not see a good enough reason to adopt a digital euro due to the vast selection of offline and online payment alternatives. The findings indicate that convincing consumers of the benefits of a CBDC will be a major challenge for policymakers, and will require a lot more research and targeted communication efforts. While the study suggested that introducing a digital euro will not disrupt financial stability, it shed some light on the fact that consumer habits pose a major hurdle to its adoption. Reasons for not adopting digital euro (Source: ECB ) The report also pointed out the importance of strategic education efforts to address consumer reluctance. It found that European consumers responded positively to video-based education and training, which means that clear and concise communication through short videos could help shift public perceptions. Consumers who were exposed to video explanations about the digital euro\u2019s key features were more likely to update their views and consider adopting the new payment method compared to those who received no such information. The study was released at a time when US lawmakers are stepping up opposition to central bank digital currencies. At a House Financial Services Committee hearing on March 11, Representative Tom Emmer argued that Congress should prioritize stablecoin legislation while blocking any potential introduction of a US CBDC. Emmer described CBDCs as inherently un-American and insisted that unelected officials should not have the power to issue them. He also reintroduced the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, which seeks to prevent future US administrations from launching a central bank digital currency. Emmer speaks during the House Financial Services Committee Hearing While resistance to CBDCs remains strong in the US, there are calls in Europe to move forward with the digital euro. Stablecoin Adoption Surges in Latin America Despite the US and Europe being hesitant to adopt stablecoins and CBDCs, stablecoin adoption in Latin America is on the rise as users increasingly turn to Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT for financial stability. This is according to a new report from cryptocurrency exchange Bitso. The report revealed that stablecoins accounted for 39% of total purchases on Bitso in 2024, which was a 9% increase from the previous year. The growing reliance on stablecoins is attributed to economic instability in the region, particularly high inflation and currency devaluation, making USDC and USDT preferred stores of value. Top 10 purchased cryptos on Bitso in 2024 (Source: Bitso ) While stablecoin purchases surged, Bitcoin trading on Bitso declined a lot, and dropped to 22% of total purchases from 38% in the second half of 2023. The report suggests that this shift indicates a growing preference for the hodl strategy, where investors accumulate Bitcoin for long-term gains rather than active trading. The decline in BTC purchases also coincided with the bull market of 2024, during which Bitcoin surpassed $100,000 for the first time in December. As Bitcoin buying slowed, stablecoin purchases increased, with USDC leading at 24% of total transactions, followed by USDT at 15%. Top crypto assets by country (Source: Bitso ) Argentina was the strongest market for USDT, with the stablecoin making up 50% of all crypto purchases in the country. Given Argentina\u2019s inflation rates, stablecoins have become an essential financial tool for local users. USDC purchases accounted for 22% of the country\u2019s total crypto transactions, while Bitcoin purchases were only 8%, the lowest among the analyzed nations. In contrast, Bitcoin was the most purchased cryptocurrency in Brazil and Mexico, where it accounted for 22% and 25% of total transactions, respectively.", "published_on": "2025-03-14T13:26:45", "url": "https://coinpaper.com/7986/us-bankers-fight-stablecoin-bill-as-threat-to-market-share", "source": "coinpaper", "categories": ["FIAT", "MARKET", "BTC", "USDT", "REGULATION"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.0666090785907859, "subjectivity": 0.3380179847253018, "sentiment": "neutral"}, "entities": ["bitcoin", "near protocol"], "topics": ["digital", "stablecoin", "stablecoins", "financial"]}, {"id": "41628774", "title": "XRP Army Rejoices As Ripple Enters Negotiation Phase to End SEC Lawsuit", "body": "Discussions are ongoing between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple regarding a potential settlement, focusing on whether XRP should be classified as a commodity rather than a security. Charles Gasparino, a journalist from Fox Business, recently shared insights on the matter, referencing information from fellow journalist Eleanor Terrett. According to Gasparino, a key issue under consideration by the SEC is \u201cwhether $XRP continues to trade and have a utility that makes it more a commodity and not a security.\u201d He further noted that the case of Ethereum (ETH) is an important reference point in these discussions. Gasparino stated, \u201cETH was obviously issued as an ICO; its characteristics on issuance was no different than XRP\u2014both used to finance the buildout of a platform, yet Ripple got sued and Ethereum didn\u2019t because $ETH had since morphed into a commodity.\u201d SCOOP: Off of @EleanorTerrett 's scoop from yesterday on the @Ripple \u2013 @SECGov settlement negotiations, one issue that is being weighed by the commission is whether $XRP continues to trade and have a utility that makes it more a commodity and not a security. I am told the\u2026 \u2014 Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) March 13, 2025 XRP\u2019s Classification Compared to Ethereum The comparison between XRP and Ethereum is significant, as the SEC has already classified Ethereum as a commodity despite its initial issuance as an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). Gasparino explained that \u201cwhat is being discussed now is the comparison between the two cryptos,\u201d highlighting the SEC\u2019s attempt to determine whether XRP could receive the same treatment as Ethereum. He added, \u201cThe SEC believe Eth trades as pure commodity. They are trying to determine if the commission can make that case w $XRP.\u201d This development follows years of legal proceedings between Ripple and the SEC . It began in December 2020 when the commission filed a lawsuit against Ripple, alleging that the company had conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP. Since then, Ripple has argued that XRP should not be considered a security, emphasizing its decentralized nature and use in cross-border transactions.

If $ETH is a commodity, then there\u2019s no argument. $XRP should be, too!\u201d The user also expressed confidence that regulatory clarity would ultimately favor XRP, saying, \u201cRegulatory clarity is inevitable, and when it happens, $XRP will be unstoppable. Utility always wins!\u201d The broader implications of these discussions could be substantial for XRP holders and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. If XRP were officially recognized as a commodity, it could bring greater regulatory clarity and potentially remove barriers to wider adoption. However, the SEC\u2019s final decision remains uncertain, and market participants closely monitor developments. As negotiations between Ripple and the SEC progress, the question of XRP\u2019s classification remains a pivotal issue. The outcome could not only shape the future of XRP but also set a precedent for how other cryptocurrencies are regulated in the United States.

When Will ETH Price Bounce Back appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As Bitcoin (BTC) price attempts to mirror gold\u2019s parabolic move, Ethereum (ETH) price has suffered a relentless bearish outlook. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $228 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $19 billion, has been trapped in a multi-week correction. Since the second inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump, Ethereum price has lost two crucial support levels, around $3,200 and $2,200. In the past three weeks, Ether\u2019s price has dropped over 33 percent to trade at about $1,891 on Friday, March 14, during the early European trading session. Ethereum Whales Buys the Capitulation-Fear As major stock indexes, led by the S&P 500, continue to bleed amid the heightened mid-term uncertainty triggered by the U.S. tariff wars, long-term traders and institutional investors have continued to take refuge in the gold and stablecoins market. According to on-chain data from Glassnode, long-term Ether holders are in notable fear. Meanwhile, the U.S. spot Ether ETF issues are about to register the third consecutive week of cash outflow after recording a net outflow of about $73 million on Thursday. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1900299328360747083?s=46 Is the Bottom In Yet? For the past year, Ethereum price has faced intense bearish sentiment after experiencing a heightened resistance level of around $4k. From a technical analysis standpoint, the ETH/USD is heavily oversold compared to Bitcoin. As a result, Ether\u2019s price must rebound from the current support level to avoid further capitulation towards $1.5k in the coming weeks. Additionally, the ETH/BTC pair has been retesting a crucial support level of around 0.023 in the past week, which could incubate bullish sentiment in the near future. Silver Lining The Ethereum network remains undisputed in the decentralized financial (DeFi) space, with around $45 billion in total value locked (TVL) and over $123 billion in stablecoins market cap. In a bid to remain competitive amid the rising adoption of alternative layer one (L1) chains led by Solana (SOL), the Ethereum core developers are working on launching the Pectra upgrade soon.

She pointed to escalating trade tensions and unpredictable tariff battles as major risks, saying that his economic decisions are fueling \u201ca level of uncertainty that we haven\u2019t seen in a long time.\u201d Speaking to the BBC on Thursday, Christine said that if a full-scale trade war erupts, global markets will take a severe hit. \u201cIf we were to go to a real trade war where trade would be dampened significantly, that would have severe consequences,\u201d said Christine. \u201cFor growth around the world and for prices around the world, but particularly in the United States.\u201d Trump\u2019s tariff threats set off global panic Since returning to the White House, Trump has reignited his aggressive tariff agenda, rolling out new economic policies at random and crashing global markets every other day. Just this Thursday, he announced plans to impose a 200% tariff on French wine, champagne, and other European alcoholic beverages, which came after the European Union (EU) proposed a tax on American whiskey exports, a direct response to Trump\u2019s earlier steel and aluminum tariffs that went into effect on Wednesday. During her interview , Christine made it clear that: \u201cAny trade war is going to hurt the global economy. The initiator, the retaliator, the re-retaliator, and so on and so forth\u2014all of that is going to hurt growth at large.\u201d She stressed that trade conflicts always lead to economic damage, affecting some countries more than others, but ultimately ensuring that everyone loses. Christine also dismissed Trump\u2019s claim that the EU was \u201cformed to screw\u201d the United States. She called the statement historically inaccurate and pointed out that the EU was actually built with American support after World War II to stabilize Europe. \u201cTo argue that it was set up to screw the United States is not just bad language, but it is an abuse of history,\u201d Christine said to BBC. Business leaders panic as Trump\u2019s policies create economic uncertainty As Trump\u2019s erratic economic decisions play out, top business executives are scrambling to figure out what comes next. CEOs from IBM, Qualcomm, and HP have been making frantic calls to the White House, demanding clarity on the administration\u2019s tariff agenda. They no longer believe they can convince Trump to reverse his trade decisions, but they are desperate for some kind of predictability. Last Monday, Trump met with top executives in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. During the closed-door discussion, tech CEOs shared concerns that the tariffs could severely damage their industries. But instead of addressing their worries, Trump told reporters afterward that the meeting focused on business investments in the US. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett has reportedly spent the past two days on the phone with the CEOs, trying to reassure them. Even some Republican lawmakers have admitted that they are not confident in Trump\u2019s economic strategy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged last week that the economy needed a \u201cdetox\u201d but avoided giving specifics. On Sunday, Trump himself admitted in a Fox News interview that his tariffs could push the economy into a recession but refused to change course. That same day, his comments caused a stock market panic, triggering a massive selloff that wiped out every gain on Wall Street since his first election in 2016. By Tuesday, Trump was downplaying concerns, saying the economy was strong, and that he doesn\u2019t care about the stock market, because it\u2019s a \u201cfake economy.\u201d But White House spokesperson Kush Desai dismissed claims of internal division, insisting that Trump\u2019s team is united. \u201cEvery member of the Trump administration is playing from the same playbook\u2014President Trump\u2019s playbook\u2014to enact an America First agenda of tariffs, tax cuts, deregulation, and the unleashing of American energy,\u201d Desai said on Thursday.

Source: Court document reviewed by Cointelegraph Kempton noted that these rules were enforced against crypto mining firm Jones Eagle LLC, which is run by Qimin \u201cJimmy\u201d Chen, a naturalized US citizen of Chinese origin. Kempton specifically pointed to the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution in arguing the illegality of Rule K and Act 174. Related: Russia bans crypto mining for 6 years in 10 regions The Equal Protection Clause similarly prohibits the US states from denying any person equal protection of the laws based on the person\u2019s race, alienage or national origin. The crypto mining executive also argued that Rule K and Act 174 strip American citizens like Chen of due process rights under the 14th Amendment. Kempton also said the prohibitions and penalties imposed under Act 174 infringe on the federal government\u2019s authority to investigate, review and take action on foreign investments. \u201cAct 174 seeks to establish Arkansas's own foreign policy, thereby intruding upon the federal government's exclusive power to govern foreign affairs.\u201d District Court Judge Kristine G.

United States President Donald Trump assumed office in November for a second term, but since then, the US stock market has dropped by about 10%. Since the global recession hit the markets hard in 2009, this is the worst start to a US presidency. Although there are numerous causes for this decline, uncertainty on economic strategy and worries about inflation have contributed. In the past, it has often signaled impending volatility when the S&P 500 and Bitcoin decline simultaneously. The bear market of 2022, which saw prolonged losses, was the last time both markets fell precipitously at the same time. Not all dips, though, lead to protracted downturns. Some have led to a notable rebound, especially since the cryptocurrency\u2019s halving cycles. How is the market reacting to Trump\u2019s second term? Since his return, the S&P 500 has fallen 9%, marking the worst start to a presidency since 2009. Back then, a recession drove the drop. This time, uncertainty is in the driver\u2019s seat. Let\u2019s dive into the data \ud83e\uddf5\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/A10F0qtweB \u2014 CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 12, 2025 Bitcoin And Stocks Moving Together\u2014For Now Bitcoin has long been known as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d but it is now functioning more like a tech stock. According to a CryptoQuant research, Bitcoin\u2019s price has tracked traditional markets, particularly the S&P 500. This pattern is not new. During the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the crypto and stocks fell together before recovering later that year. But IntoTheBlock analysts found that Bitcoin\u2019s relationship to the S&P 500 has dropped to essentially zero. This would suggest that, in line with long-term holders\u2019 pattern, BTC is starting to migrate outside of conventional finance. Should this decoupling continue, the movement in the price of Bitcoin might rely less on changes in the stock market. Historical Trends Suggest A Recovery According to CryptoQuant, prior data shows that Bitcoin has frequently rebounded following strong corrections. For example, in 2018, Bitcoin lost approximately 80% of its value before recovering in 2019. Similarly, following the 2020 crash, Bitcoin reached fresh all-time highs in 2021. Another statistic to keep an eye on is the Coinbase Premium Index, which measures the difference in Bitcoin prices between Coinbase and Binance. When this indicator goes negative and then returns to positive territory, it has typically indicated an impending price rebound. Related Reading: $931 Million BTC On The Move: Mt.

Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn granted a temporary restraining order on March 12, requested by Bitcoin miner Consensus Colocation and systems owner Stone Ridge Ventures against Mawson Hosting, which provides hosting and colocation services for Bitcoin miners. The firms have been in disagreement over alleged unpaid fees, the terms of their agreement and Consensus\u2019 plan to relocate, allegedly leading to Mawson blocking the miner\u2019s personnel from accessing the site. The firms have also alleged Mawson has been operating the rigs since Feb. 28 for their own gain after preventing Consensus from entering the premises. Mawson, however, claims they are allowed to use the rigs under the terms of its agreement with Consensus, and they have the right of first refusal for its relocation plans. The Bitcoin miner has been seeking injunctive relief to regain control of their equipment and prevent Mawson from using them. As part of the March 12 order, Mawson is barred from using the hashrate from the miners and will no longer be allowed to restrict Consensus\u2019s digital and physical access to the rigs in the Midland, Pennsylvania, facility. A Delaware judge has granted a temporary restraining order barring Mawson Infrastructure Group from using the rigs at the Midland, Pennsylvania, facility. Source: Law360 The temporary restraining is in force until the matter can be heard in a preliminary injunction hearing. Mawson Infrastructure Group and Consensus Colocation did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph's request for comment. How the dispute began In a March 6 legal complaint, lawyers acting for Consensus accused Mawson of mining Bitcoin ( BTC ) with their rigs \u2014 valued at $30 million \u2014 since Feb. 28, generating daily profits of between $100,000 and $200,000 while blocking access to them both physically and through VPN access. Consensus and Stone Ridge signed a colocation agreement with Mawson in December 2023. They agreed to terminate the partnership by the end of March 2025, with a gradual reduction in capacity leading up to the deadline and a removal process scheduled to begin on March 3. Mawson argues that it was owed fees and electricity prepayments for February and March, and its colocation agreement gives it the right to redirect the hashrate of Consensus\u2019 miners and use the proceeds to replenish the deposit. Related: US-Canada tariff flip-flops have Bitcoin miners on their toes \u201cOn its face, it was operative only prior to April 1, 2024, and only in narrow circumstances relating to the replenishment of a deposit,\u201d lawyers acting for Consensus said in the suit. \u201cWhen Mawson began redirecting the hashrate on Feb. 28, the deposit was fully paid.

In December of last year, Ethena unveiled USDtb, a stablecoin intended to complement Ethena USDe ( USDe ), its synthetic currency. Mainly backed by BUIDL, USDtb has rapidly increased in supply.

Current Price Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $0.70, having registered a 3% price drop in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume declined by 10%, indicating reduced participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, ADA is currently near a crucial support zone at $0.68 and $0.65, while $0.75 is acts as a strong resistance level, potentially hindering further rally attempts. Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if ADA breaches the 200 EMA and closes a daily candle above the $0.75 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 50% to reach the $1.13 mark.

While these established tokens dominate DeFi, trading and payments, this emerging contender is tackling real-world financial challenges in a way no other has. With a revolutionary approach to cross-border transactions, seamless crypto-to-fiat integration and explosive presale success, this altcoin is quickly gaining traction. Could this be the next major crypto to watch in 2025? Solana ETF Filing by Franklin Templeton Sparks Optimism for 2025 Solana has experienced its share of challenges in 2025. After a 14.2% weekly decline, it is trading around $122 , still far from its January peak. Even though other blockchain networks are active, Solana is one of the most vibrant platforms. It provides resources for DeFi implementations and NFT systems. The SEC regulatory authority shows increasing interest in Solana, as Franklin Templeton filed an ETF application , which Bloomberg predicts will receive approval before 2025. Several analysts predict a competing crypto project will replace Solana as the next disruptive blockchain alternative. SOL has solidified its position as a major blockchain for speed and scalability, but this emerging project brings different innovations through its disruptive financial model. The integration of blockchain into practical applications, particularly in payment systems, leads experts to believe that this project will supersede Solana, XRP and BNB. XRP Gains 3.72% As Market Optimism Sparks Short-Term Rally XRP remains one of the key players in the crypto space. Aftermarket fluctuations, the cryptocurrency\u2019s value has regained stability and reached $2.24 , a 3.72% increase. XRP showed swift price recovery following its previous dip below $2, reflecting positive market sentiment. The discussion of including XRP in the U.S. Digital Assets Stockpile leads analysts to believe that institutional demand will drive the asset price upwards. However, XRP\u2019s long-term direction remains unclear because regulatory ambiguity persists. Experiments in the evolving digital asset environment have traders doubting XRP\u2019s ability to stay in the top position. XRP maintains value from its established cross-border payment capabilities, although competition within this sector remains active. New blockchain projects have gained attention from investors because they offer swifter transactions, reduced fees and stronger institutional partnerships. BNB Sees High Liquidity But Fails To Tap Into The Remittance Market The price of Binance Coin (BNB) remains strong at around $576 , and daily trading volume remains over $2.4 billion. The Binance Smart Chain depends on BNB to power its DeFi application network, which provides quick and economically beneficial transactions. Deep market liquidity combined with institutional support enables BNB to stay at the top of its market sector. However, investor assessments of BNB\u2019s future growth potential started changing due to centralization issues and emerging competition from new blockchain platforms. BNB faces a key business opportunity because, despite its broad adoption, it has not yet penetrated the remittance market. Emerging blockchain projects provide alternative solutions that process transactions swifter while demanding diminished fees, despite Binance\u2019s established position in crypto trading. Rising regulatory oversight in the market has pushed investors to look for decentralized alternatives that do not need a single organization. With a new crypto contender gaining traction, analysts believe it could outshine top altcoins like BNB, Solana and even XRP. This rising star is disrupting traditional finance with real-world applications, leading many to believe it might be the next major player in the crypto industry. This New Crypto Could Outperform BNB And Reshape The Global Payments Industry Remittix (RTX) is emerging as a game-changer in the digital payments sector, with analysts predicting its potential to surpass giants like Solana, XRP and BNB. With its presale already generating massive traction at $0.0734 per token, Remittix is proving that real-world utility is what investors want. Unlike speculative assets that rely on hype, RTX focuses on bridging crypto with fiat seamlessly through its PayFi technology, enabling instant, low-cost global transactions. While blockchain leaders like Solana and BNB have established their dominance in DeFi and trading ecosystems, they haven\u2019t made significant strides in cross-border remittances. This is where Remittix disrupts the market. By eliminating excessive fees and long transaction times that plague traditional financial systems, RTX offers a practical and scalable alternative that could see mass adoption among businesses and individuals alike. Remittix Presale Surges As Experts See It As The Next Big Crypto Crypto experts are increasingly viewing Remittix as the next major player, not just for its financial inclusivity but for its potential to reshape the payments landscape. With a well-structured ecosystem and long-term growth strategy, RTX is on track to outperform legacy blockchain networks that fail to address real-world problems. As traditional banks and fintech firms explore blockchain-based remittance solutions, Remittix stands in a prime position to lead the charge potentially making one of the top altcoins of 2025.

On Thursday, Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, the Ranking Member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urging the department to halt all efforts to create the cryptocurrency reserve. Connolly warned that the initiative primarily serves to enrich Trump and his financial backers rather than benefiting the American public. \u201cSuch a reserve provides no discernible benefit to the American people but would significantly enrich the President and his donors,\u201d Connolly wrote. He also criticized the plan as reckless fiscal policy, arguing that it would artificially elevate Bitcoin over other currencies through social media hype and misallocate taxpayer funds. Connolly cited a Federal Reserve official who had reportedly dismissed the idea as \u201cthe dumbest\u201d proposal ever. NEW: RM @GerryConnolly sent a letter to @USTreasury Secretary Bessent urging the Department to cease all attempts to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, citing President Trump\u2019s glaring conflicts of interest. https://t.co/EK106k15oF \u2014 Oversight Committee Democrats (@OversightDems) March 13, 2025 Trump\u2019s Bitcoin Reserve Plan Taps Government\u2019s Crypto Holdings Trump\u2019s executive order, signed earlier this month, directs the federal government to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve , initially capitalized with about 200,000 Bitcoin already in the government\u2019s possession. Additionally, the order creates the US Digital Asset Stockpile, a separate entity designed to manage other forfeited cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano. While the Treasury may explore options for managing these digital assets, it will not actively expand the stockpile beyond assets seized through legal actions. Democrat Flags Trump\u2019s Stake in Crypto Ventures, Citing Conflict of Interest Further, Connolly\u2019s letter raises concerns over Trump\u2019s personal financial ties to the crypto industry, arguing that his business interests could influence federal policy in ways that serve him personally. The lawmaker specifically pointed to Trump\u2019s stake in World Liberty Financial , a crypto-based financial services company that aims to function as a digital asset bank. Trump, who maintains a significant ownership position in the venture, stands to profit immensely if federal policy bolsters cryptocurrency values, he said. Additionally, Connolly flagged Trump\u2019s involvement in $TRUMP, a meme-based cryptocurrency that has generated substantial revenue through trading fees. Reports suggest Trump-linked entities have already raked in as much as $100m from the token, which critics have described as his \u201cmost lucrative get-rich scheme yet.\u201d Beyond the ethical concerns, Connolly said that Trump has moved forward with the Bitcoin reserve plan without seeking congressional input or authorization. The lawmaker argued that such an initiative, which could have far-reaching implications for financial markets and federal monetary policy, demands a thorough legislative review. As pressure mounts, the Treasury Department has yet to publicly comment on whether it will proceed with Trump\u2019s controversial executive order.

Others have even suggested that the incident could benefit Hyperliquid\u2019s native HYPE token in the long run. Lessons Learned The loss occurred when a trader, identified by the wallet address 0xf3f4, opened a 175,000 ETH long position with 50 times leverage, valued at $340 million. After securing an unrealized profit of $8 million, the trader reportedly withdrew $17.09 million in margin, triggering an automatic liquidation of the remaining 160,000 ETH. Hyperliquid\u2019s HLP vault absorbed the position at $1,915 per ETH, putting it $4 million in the red. However, some analysts remain optimistic about the platform\u2019s future. Prominent DeFi commentator Aylo argued that stress tests, like the one Hyperliquid went through, are necessary to improve protocol design. \u201cIn this case, 1% hit on HLP was a very reasonable price to pay for the lesson learned and the apparent vulnerabilities discovered,\u201d he said. Additionally, he noted that while HYPE remains a risky investment given prevailing market conditions, its revenue stream and market share in the perps trading space make it undervalued. According to data from DefiLlama, the token\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 7.06, which, in Aylo\u2019s opinion, hints at a potential upside if Hyperliquid continues to grow. In the aftermath of the liquidation, HYPE lost 8.5% of its value but recovered soon after. Still, the broader market jitters seem to have caught up with it, dropping 11.4% from its price in the last 24 hours and just under 28% across the week. Ben Zhou Calls for More Risk Management Tools Bybit CEO Ben Zhou also weighed in on the event, highlighting the risks associated with high leverage on both centralized and decentralized exchanges. In a post on X, he explained how the protocol\u2019s liquidation engine took over the massive position and cushioned its impact by lowering leverage. The crypto executive, whose company was recently on the wrong end of the largest hack in the industry\u2019s history, suggested that DEXs must put in place stronger risk management mechanisms, including dynamic risk limits and market surveillance tools, to prevent similar occurrences in the future. The incident has prompted Hyperliquid to lower its maximum leverage for Bitcoin and Ethereum to 40x and 25x, respectively. He pointed out that HLP had been operating successfully for about two years with minimal issues and that the team has a track record of quick responses to challenges.

During the coronavirus pandemic, the K Bank-Upbit partnership proved enormously successful. South Korean law requires all fiat-trading crypto exchanges to strike deals with domestic banks. The latter provide exchange customers with social security number-verified fiat on/off ramps. During the pandemic, the parties were the only banking-exchange duo able to offer new clients the ability to crypto wallet-linked bank accounts online. At the time, other banks still required new customers to open in-person accounts in high-street branches. Since then, other banks have followed suit, and have begun allowing their customers to open crypto exchange-linked bank accounts online.

Meetings took place this week as officials looked for the best way to store and manage the nation\u2019s crypto holdings, which include nearly 200,000 BTC, worth around $17.5 billion at today\u2019s prices. The discussions are part of an effort to determine whether the government should self-custody its Bitcoin or use third-party firms, said the report. Treasury weighs custody options for billions in Bitcoin Anchorage\u2019s Nathan McCauley reportedly confirmed that government officials asked detailed questions about how to properly secure Bitcoin at a national level, what role stablecoins might play in the process, and how custody decisions could affect the overall crypto market structure. \u201cThe Treasury Department is asking all the right questions,\u201d McCauley said. \u201cThey understand that this is historic.\u201d The Treasury is still undecided on how to store its growing Bitcoin reserves.

Last year, the agency tapped Coinbase to secure large-cap crypto, though we can\u2019t tell if that arrangement includes Bitcoin held by the Treasury. White House orders full accounting of US crypto reserves The Biden administration had a hostile approach toward crypto, with regulatory crackdowns that forced many companies to operate in uncertainty. But under President Donald Trump, the government has turned pro-crypto for the very first time ever. Trump\u2019s executive order on the strategic Bitcoin reserve directed the Treasury and Commerce Department to explore how the US can add a ton to its Bitcoin holdings while making sure that the strategy remains budget neutral. At the White House, David Sacks, Trump\u2019s AI and crypto czar, has been tasked with overseeing the process. Speaking to reporters last week, Sacks confirmed that a full accounting of the federal government\u2019s Bitcoin reserves is underway. Sacks estimated the holdings at 200,000 BTC, but acknowledged that a complete audit is needed to confirm the total. \u201cIt\u2019s a real shame that we didn\u2019t maximize value for the American taxpayer,\u201d he said after the EO. Sacks called the SBR a \u201cdigital Fort Knox for digital gold.\u201d The US quick embrace of Bitcoin has caught the attention of global regulators. Speaking at a crypto conference in Singapore on Thursday, Binance CEO Richard Teng said, \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from a period of regulatory hostility to one where the world\u2019s largest economy is saying, \u2018We want to embrace crypto.\u2019\u201d Teng also said he was excited about Trump ending Biden\u2019s infamous \u201cOperation Choke Point 2.0,\u201d which was an effort to restrict access to banking services for crypto companies. But since Trump won, the banking climate has changed dramatically. Crypto companies that previously struggled to get banking relationships are now finding it easier to work with financial institutions. Hashkey Capital\u2019s Deng agreed, calling the return of banking services for crypto companies one of the biggest changes under the new administration. \u201cBanks are now more comfortable working with crypto clients,\u201d Deng said. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge step for the crypto and Web3 industry.\u201d Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Fold Holdings offers Bitcoin rewards through banking services but faces challenges scaling beyond Bitcoin enthusiasts due to competitive cash-back alternatives. Fold's future business lines, like Bitcoin-based loans, are intriguing, but current revenue growth expectations seem overly optimistic. Fold's convertible note deal appears more PR-driven than beneficial, making FLD shares a 'hold' rather than a compelling investment today. With the recently announced US Strategic Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) Reserve now in the rear view mirror, it turns out that the 'big money printing bidder' that many expected to enter the Bitcoin frenzy isn't doing so any time soon. This is perhaps an underwhelming development for those who were hoping taxpayers would be pumping Maxi bags. Such is life. But, I'm of the view that the 'do-nothing' SBR is actually a good thing for Bitcoin. This network is going to have to stand on its own two feet and provide value to the world without the backstop of the very currency con that it was created to eliminate. My view is US-based companies have been given the green light to try things out. It's good news. And as investors, we can now look beyond narratives and try to find companies that are actually using this stuff. Perhaps one such company is the newly public Fold Holdings Inc. ( FLD ). Fold's Business Model Simply put; Fold Holdings offers banking and credit services to consumers, with the ability to generate Bitcoin rewards as the primary hook. During an IPO-day interview with Schwab Network in February, Fold's CEO Will Reeves described the business in this way: The way it works for Fold rewards is every time you swipe our credit card or our debit card, Fold receives income revenue from the Visa networks. We then go and convert that into Bitcoin on behalf of our users as a form of full Bitcoin rewards. As Reeves explains it, Fold's rewards are designed to appreciate in value, while competing programs from companies like airlines could see those rewards devalued. On the surface, that certainly makes some sense. But I can't help but wonder if a standard cash back rewards card will ultimately be the better product for BTC acquisition over time. Given Fold is essentially generating revenue from the same interchange that other rewards programs generate revenue from, I think scaling this business beyond a few strong Bitcoin supporters is likely going to be a challenge. Credit Card Pricing (Fold) Keep in mind, Fold's upcoming credit card will offer 1.5% back to free tier users. To get the 2% cash back reward, users have to pay $100 annually to join the Fold+ tier. There are other benefits to this tier, including the elimination of fees for users who buy, sell, or convert a direct cash deposit to Bitcoin. And frankly, users don't have to spend all that much annually on the card to make the Fold+ fee worthwhile. But when I see products like this, my natural instinct is to assess how compelling I think it is to switch from what people are already likely using. For me, I already have a cash back rewards card that pays 2% on everything without an annual fee. So if I was so inclined, I could just continue to use my Fidelity credit card, take the cash back and buy Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust ( FBTC ) shares with those rewards if I want Bitcoin exposure with cash back from my credit card. This admittedly requires an extra step and can't be withdrawn, but I don't have to open any new accounts and go through KYC/AML. I'm not sure I'm a huge fan of this business segment, to be honest. January Investor Deck, Slide 22 (Fold) That said, I do think some of Fold's longer term business lines are quite interesting. During his appearance on the Schwab Network, Reeves mentioned business loans and home ownership utilizing Bitcoin. Essentially, putting the Bitcoin to work is something that I think could conceivably make Fold more compelling as an investment, specifically because the company's 575k user base is generally higher net worth. After generating $24 million in top line revenue last year, Fold is guiding for $61.6 million for 2025. This year will also see Fold's expansion into custody and trading beyond banking and payment services. Bitcoin Holdings & Convertible Note At a market cap of $300 million, FLD trades at nearly 5x forward sales. It's clearly a growth company, and, based on that metric alone, perhaps isn't as 'overvalued' as it could be. Despite the enthusiasm for projected revenue growth, I'd be very cautious about some of these expectations: January Investor Deck, Slide 21 (Fold) Consider that 2024, a year in which Bitcoin appreciated by 135%, Fold's revenue was still below that of 2022. Boosting marketing spend up to 25% of operating budget is probably necessary to get more users into Fold's funnel. And in addition to cross-selling current users more financial services, the company appears to be joining Michael Saylor's convertible note party . FLD Bitcoin Holdings (BitcoinTreasuries.Net) After announcing a 475 Bitcoin acquisition following an early-March convertible note sale, Fold now holds 1,485 BTC on the balance sheet and is a top-20 listed company based on BTC holdings. At a BTC price of $81k, Fold's Bitcoin Treasury has a market value of $120.3 million. However, the devil is in the details and that 475 Bitcoin came following a $46.3 million security sale to SATS Credit Fund LP. The deeper specifics of the arrangement are quite interesting and not necessarily as good a deal as is perhaps believed by the company's supporters. Per Fold's 8-K earlier this month: Fold has agreed to hold the Subject Bitcoin in its treasury and may not use it for operational or any other purposes unless and until released to Fold upon conversion of the Note\u2019s principal into Conversion Shares. Any Subject Bitcoin that is not released to Fold on or prior to the Maturity Date in connection with the issuance of Conversion Shares will be repaid to the Investor on the Maturity Date as payment of the principal outstanding under the Note. Essentially, this isn't Fold's Bitcoin. It still belongs to the convertible note investor. And while that note doesn't mature until 2030, the coupon is 7%. In order for SATS Credit Fund LP to relinquish the entirety of the BTC to Fold, the investor will be paid quarterly interest through common stock valued at $12.50 per share. Automatic conversions trigger based on the following: Principal Common Shares FLD Reference Price $4.6 million 370,000 $15 $4.6 million 370,000 $20 $4.6 million 740,000 $25 $9.3 million 740,000 $30 $9.3 million 740,000 $35 $9.3 million 740,000 $40 Source: Fold 8-K Thus, 60% of the principal requires a share price of $30 or higher for automatic conversion to trigger. While this has been presented as though it's the same playbook that has been used by Saylor, I don't see this really being the same kind of deal that MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) has been getting. Frankly, it appears - at least to me - to be more of a PR tactic since BTC held through corporate treasury has generally been getting rewarded by the market. Closing Thoughts For me, Fold is an interesting company but not one that I feel compelled to invest in today. I'm not generally a huge fan of the rewards business, and I think the convertible note is an attempt to 'sell the sizzle' through BTC Treasury optics rather than outright owned assets. I'll call FLD shares a 'hold' today.", "published_on": "2025-03-14T11:56:59", "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4767504-fold-holdings-a-real-world-bitcoin-based-business-model?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article", "source": "seekingalpha", "categories": ["BTC", "BUSINESS", "REGULATION", "TRADING", "MARKET"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.12931354359925787, "subjectivity": 0.40127739984882843, "sentiment": "positive"}, "entities": ["bitcoin"], "topics": ["fold", "reward", "company", "million", "business"]}, {"id": "41625050", "title": "Crypto Market Today (Mar 14): BTC Slips Below $82K; Altcoins Flux; TRUMP Soars 10%", "body": "The crypto market today (March 14) has again pushed investors on their toes, showcasing fluctuations.

Ripple\u2019s legal team is currently negotiating for better terms after a court ruling in August 2023. The ruling imposed a $125 million fine on Ripple and stopped the company from selling XRP to institutional investors. The delay in the settlement is because Ripple wants to change the terms of the court decision. Reports suggest that Ripple\u2019s team is arguing that if the SEC is easing up on other crypto companies, Ripple should not still face penalties. Ripple believes that accepting the current terms would make them admit wrongdoing, but the SEC is now unsure if any wrongdoing actually happened. Charles Gasparino, reacting to the situation, added that one key issue the SEC is considering is whether XRP should be treated like Ethereum. Both XRP and Ethereum were sold through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) to raise funds for their platforms. But while Ripple got sued over XRP, Ethereum wasn\u2019t, because it became a commodity. The SEC is now debating whether XRP should also be considered a commodity like Ethereum. SCOOP: Off of @EleanorTerrett 's scoop from yesterday on the @Ripple \u2013 @SECGov settlement negotiations, one issue that is being weighed by the commission is whether $XRP continues to trade and have a utility that makes it more a commodity and not a security. I am told the\u2026 \u2014 Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) March 13, 2025 \u201c What is being discussed now is the comparison between the 2 cryptos. The SEC believes ETH trades as pure commodity. They are trying to determine if the commission can make that case w $XRP,\u201d Gasparino wrote. Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton suggested that the SEC consider a few important points before making a final decision: A 2018 article by Giancarlo (former Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission) argued that XRP is not a security. A 2018 SEC analysis didn\u2019t label XRP as a security or suggest enforcement actions against Ripple.

Chainlink (LINK) price movement indicates mild bearish momentum Chainlink (LINK) continues to experience notable price volatility, recording a dip of 11.06% in the past week, and a decline of 27.64% over the past month. However, LINK\u2019s price has surged 22.48% over the past six months, revealing a potential for long-term growth although the short-term declines suggest otherwise. According to CoinMarketCap data, LINK is currently trading between $12.03 and $16.60. LINK\u2019s price range has maintained within its 10-day simple moving average of $13.04 but below its 100-day average of $13.96. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 53.19 suggests a neutral market stance, and the slightly negative MACD level at -0.0162 indicates a mild bearish momentum. LINK traders are observing the $19 level as the closest resistance zone, and they project a potential rise towards the second resistance zone around the $23.99 level which roughly represents a 40% increase\u2013if the price breaks above that price. Conversely, they identify $10.27 as the closest support level and they anticipate a potential 50% drop to the second support level at $5.70 if the price falls below $10. Traders are monitoring these upper and lower price levels to form predictions on LINK\u2019s future price movement. Cardano (ADA) price experiences heightened volatility Cardano\u2019s ADA token has recently been experiencing persistent downward price movement with the 24.08% price drop over the last seven days indicating short-term decline. However, ADA\u2019s surge by 5.09% in the last 14 days reveals potential for upward price movement in the long run. ADA is currently trading between $0.56 and $1.03, and traders have identified $0.40 as the nearest support level that also acts as a potential floor if the price falls below its current level. Traders also see $1.33 as the nearest resistance level and $1.80 as a second resistance zone. RSI, SMA, and MACD technical indicators jointly suggest a moderately positive future for ADA although the impact is almost negligible when considered separately. The token\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 57.84 indicates neutrality\u2013revealing that the asset is neither being overbought nor being oversold. The 10-day and the 100-day Simple Moving Average(s) show steady growth at $0.73 and $0.75 respectively. ADA\u2019s MACD at 0.0035 the Stochastic value of 60.33 hints at the token\u2019s bullishness, suggesting continued price surge if ADA breaks through the upper resistance level. Conclusion Digital assets like LINK, ADA, and XYZ are emerging as projects with positive outlooks even as the market continues on a downtrend.
