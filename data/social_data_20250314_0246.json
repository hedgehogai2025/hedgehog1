        "text": "The largest Ethereum upgrade, in terms of EIPs included, is approaching despite some challenges faced on testnets.  \n  \nI've put together a concise thread covering the core changes that will be implemented during the Pectra upgrade.  \n  \nThis overview of the key EIPs should give you a clear understanding of the main concepts driving the upcoming changes to Ethereum.  \n  \nHere\u2019s what to expect in Ethereum Pectra  \ud83d\udc47\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/it6o8swg98oe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ed29b743b436c92820cf3d7c73efbce9485cbb4\n\n1/ **EIP-2537: Precompile for BLS12-381 curve operations**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: Alex Vlasov, Kelly Olson, Alex Stokes, Antonio Sanso\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 The current cryptographic tools in Ethereum, particularly the BN254 precompile, are not robust enough for applications that require enhanced security. The BLS12-381 curve provides stronger cryptographic features and is being more widely adopted across blockchain platforms for improved security.\n\n\n\n2/ **EIP-2935: Save historical block hashes in state**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2935](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2935)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: Vitalik Buterin, Tomasz Stanczak, Guillaume Ballet, Gajinder Singh, Tanishq Jasoria, Ignacio Hagopian, Jochem Brouwer, Sina Mahmoodi\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 Ethereum currently depends on clients for recent block hashes, which is not a future-proof approach. This proposal addresses the limitation by embedding block hashes in the state, enhancing accessibility and enabling features like extended proof validation and rollup interaction.\n\n\n\n3/ **EIP-6110: Supply validator deposits on chain**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6110](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6110)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: Mikhail Kalinin, Danny Ryan, Peter Davies\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 The current mechanism relies on the complex deposit voting process in the Consensus Layer. This proposal removes deposit voting from the Consensus Layer, shifting the responsibility for deposit inclusion and validation to the Execution Layer. The goal is to improve security, simplify client design, and reduce validator deposit processing delays\n\n\n\n4/ **EIP-7002: Execution layer triggerable exits**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7002](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7002)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: Danny Ryan, Mikhail Kalinin, Ansgar Dietrichs, Hsiao-Wei Wang, lightclients\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 Currently, validators need their active \"hot\" keys to initiate exits. The proposal addresses the restriction where only the active validator key could trigger withdrawals, ensuring that withdrawal credential holders have full control over their staked ETH securely and independently.\n\n\n\n5/ **EIP-7251: Increase the MAX\\_EFFECTIVE\\_BALANCE**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7251](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7251)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: Mike Neuder, Francesco, dapplion, Mikhail Kalinin, Aditya, Justin\u00a0Drake, lightclients\u00a0\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 Currently, validators are limited to 32 ETH, which forces large stakers to operate many redundant validators, and that increases network overhead and inefficiencies. This proposal would reduce the validator count, optimize resource use, and improve efficiency for both solo and large-scale stakers.\n\n\n\n6/ **EIP-7549: Move committee index outside Attestation**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7549](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7549)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: dapplion, Mikhail Kalinin\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 The current mechanism of attestations in Ethereum's Beacon Chain leads to increased computational and storage requirements for validators and ZK circuits.\n\nThe proposal's goal is to optimize Casper FFG (Friendly Finality Gadget) mechanisms that will enhance gas efficiency, scalability, and cryptographic verification.\n\n\n\n7/ **EIP-7623: Increase calldata cost**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7623](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7623)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: Toni Wahrst\u00e4tter, Vitalik Buterin\u00a0\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 Ethereum\u2019s calldata costs have remained unchanged since EIP-2028, leading to inefficiencies as rollups generate large, data-heavy blocks. This proposal adjusts calldata costs to reduce inefficiencies and align with EIP-4844's data availability changes.\n\n\n\n8/ **EIP-7685: General purpose execution layer requests**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7685](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7685)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: lightclients\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 Smart contract-controlled validators often rely on external intermediaries for administrative actions, introducing inefficiencies and risks. This proposal allows direct requests from smart contracts to the CL, streamlining operations and improving safety, scalability, and cross-layer communication for governance automation.\n\n\n\n9/ **EIP-7691: Blob throughput increase**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7691](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7691)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: Parithosh Jayanthi, Toni Wahrst\u00e4tter, Sam Calder-Mason, Andrew Davis, Ansgar Dietrichs\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 This proposal addresses current data availability limitations, offering a short-term scalability improvement for Layer 2 rollups while long-term solutions like peerDAS are being developed.\n\n\n\n10/ **EIP-7702: Set EOA account code**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: Vitalik Buterin, Sam Wilson, Ansgar Dietrichs, lightclients\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 EOAs are less programmable than smart contracts, limiting their efficiency and flexibility. This proposal introduces a mechanism to extend EOAs' functionality, improving gas optimization, security, and interoperability by bridging the gap between EOAs and contract accounts.\n\n\n\n11/ **EIP-7840: Add blob schedule to EL config files**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7840](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7840)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: lightclients\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 Currently, execution clients depend on blob configuration data for some features. Storing this data only in the consensus client leads to inefficiencies and extra API calls between clients for each block. This proposal improves performance by offloading the need for execution and consensus layers to perform excessive data handshakes.",

Once I receive the funds in my wallet, I transfer them over either to OKX or Binance, and then I sell them using the P2P trading feature to potential buyers in exchange for local currency.\n\nI want to get your opinion on my approach, do you have any tips that I should be aware of before actually going through with this?\n\n*Thanks in advance!*",

There was an estimate that it would take till at least March 28 to finalize. \n\n[Ether Guild](https://x.com/ethismoneyHQ/status/1899104142897086854) sounds like a great new community effort to promote Ethereum, focused on its value as money.  I like their graphic of Ethereum-promoting organizations in the [7th tweet](https://x.com/ethismoneyHQ/status/1899105464501326251) of that thread.

I have only 20 days or less than 20 to learn and then to think something out of the box related to web 3 or Blockchains  . I am a complete beginner in Blockchain despite of this fact I want to participate as I have heard that the winner of previous hackIndia from our college was a complete beginner and he won the regional hackathon . Also when I asked him about the ideas  , he said me and my team did lot of discussions and brain storming to achieve success in that idea . But I think he is lying because one of my close friends said he copied the idea from GitHub .I am thinking to try to implement an already built project which I have found in GitHub . Is this a very bad idea ? I am doing this because I want to participate and it's not possible for me to think and learn something that I am not much aware of but still I am trying to gain knowledge rn about those things . Please suggest me what should I do ",

        "text": "We are thrilled to announce the launch of Shutter API, a threshold encryption service designed to simplify the integration of privacy features into decentralized applications (dApps)!\n\nShutter API is now live and already powering several early-stage applications while collaborating with partners to explore new use cases.\n\nUnlike the encrypted mempool on Gnosis Chain, OP Stack, or Ethereum L1, which addresses censorship and malicious MEV at the protocol level, Shutter API focuses on the application layer, enhancing encryption accessibility for dApp developers.\n\nThis service supports commit-reveal workflows, encrypted time-locked transactions, and improves transaction privacy for various applications, including gaming, governance, and finance.\n\nEncryption is essential for Web3 adoption as it protects sensitive information and fosters fair markets. Shutter API ensures temporary privacy, allowing information to be disclosed at the right moment\u2014like a sealed envelope that only opens under specific conditions.\n\nKey use cases include:\n\n- Governance & Voting\n- Sealed-Bid Auctions\n- Fair Gaming\n- Smart Account Encryption\n- Time-Locked Gifts\n\n**How It Works:**\n\n1. **Register an Identity**\n2. **Encrypt Data**\n3. **Submit Action**\n4. **Decrypt at the Right Time**\n\nShutter API simplifies encryption integration, requiring no cryptographic expertise and minimizing trust. This is just the beginning, with more applications in development. Join our livestream tomorrow to see how encryption is shaping the future of Web3!\n\nLearn more at the Shutter Blog: [https://blog.shutter.network/introducing-shutter-api-threshold-encryption-service/](https://blog.shutter.network/introducing-shutter-api-threshold-encryption-service/)",

They're moving to faster block times (200 ms) and adding sub-accounts which can have different permissions (e.g. not having to approve small transactions every time) and layer 3s for individual apps (appchains). Base has become one of the top rollups: according to [L2 Beat](https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary) it's #1 in transactions and #2 in value secured, but it's still a stage 0 rollup (centralized, so it doesn't yet inherit all the security of Ethereum; see the [rollup stage definitions](https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe)). Kraken also recently started an Ethereum rollup, Ink. \n\nThe developers of [Gossipsub v2.0](https://ethresear.ch/t/doubling-the-blob-count-with-gossipsub-v2-0/21893), an efficient messaging protocol, say they should be able to double the number of blobs (the Ethereum data storage that rollups depend on) Ethereum can handle. \n\nphysalisx and Logris are [earning good yields](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1j6blzq/daily_general_discussion_march_08_2025/mgqlut4/) with Euler on Base. \n\nSee the [previous](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1j6or9z/yesterday_in_ethereum_saturday_march_8_2025/) Yesterday in Ethereum.",
