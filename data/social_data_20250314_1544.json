Cathie Wood explaining market volatility- Source: ARK Invest According to Cathie, market volatility is an opportunity for success. In addition to acquiring Bitcoin, Ark Invest recently increased its Coinbase (COIN) stock holdings. The company acquired 64,358 shares of Coinbase, worth about $11.53 million. This was its largest stake in Coinbase stock since August 2024. Moreover, institutional activities in the crypto space have surged. To illustrate, institutional investors have remained active holders of cryptocurrencies, most investing in Bitcoin ETFs. Despite this, they have negatively impacted the crypto market. Ark Invest sold roughly $9 million of its BTC ETFs invested in the company. This aligns with a broader institutional selling trend. Factors contributing to the selling pressure include the declining performance of the US stock market, inflation concerns, and uncertainties in trade policies. Bitcoin suffers a pullback amid trade war concerns Bitcoin holds the majority share compared to all other cryptocurrencies combined. According to CoinMarketCap , Bitcoin has 61% market dominance. Therefore, most long-term investors view Bitcoin as an essential trading asset. For instance, Wood remains a supporter of Bitcoin. She previously forecasted an increase in BTC price to $1 million per coin by 2030. However, the trading war brought about by institutional buying and selling of cryptocurrency contributes to Bitcoin price fluctuation, diminishing its strength. Nevertheless, Bitcoin\u2019s strength has diminished due to the trade war\u2019s impact, which makes the asset still bearish. Bitcoin\u2019s price traded in the $79,000 range before rising back to the $81,000 mark but faced resistance at the $83,700 level. In case the selling pressure continues, BTC\u2019s price may further decline towards the $75,000 support level. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

However, with total assets under management at $115 billion, most funds remain intact despite Bitcoin\u2019s 25% price drop.

Analysts say the recent outflows are a classic case of \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news.\u201d The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve initiative was first mentioned by Trump in July 2024, which led to speculations and more investors buying Bitcoin.

CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost noted that Bitcoin demand has fallen sharply since December. He pointed to a drop in the 30-day simple moving average of apparent demand, which compares new supply to BTC inactive for over a year. This decline indicates fewer active buyers and a more cautious market. https://twitter.com/darkfost_coc/status/1900253428846387242?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw Another concerning trend was revealed by the data analytics platform Alphractal on a Mar. 12 X post . The Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio, which determines risk-adjusted returns, has been declining since March 2024. Even as Bitcoin hit all-time highs above $100,000, the ratio showed weakness, indicating rising risk per unit of return. The decline can be attributed to macroeconomic uncertainty, increased volatility, and slowing short-term returns. Returns become less predictable and more volatile when the Sharpe Ratio declines, indicating increased market volatility and possible price corrections . Additionally, Santiment\u2019s data indicates that large Bitcoin holders are selling. In the past week, whale wallets, or those with 100-1,000 BTC, sold over 50,000 BTC totaling approximately $4.07 billion. Changes in whale and shark wallet tiers have historically affected market trends, raising more questions about the short-term prospects of Bitcoin.

The mid-cap dog-themed memecoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $7.2 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $169 million, has dropped more than 22 percent in the past four weeks to trade about $0.00001239 on Friday, March 14, during the mid-London trading session. As the largest memecoin on the Ethereum network, Shiba Inu price has moved in tandem with Ethereum. Consequently, a potential V-shaped reversal for Ether in the near future could directly impact Shiba Inu price action and the wider altcoin market. Shiba Inu Chart Insights From a technical analysis standpoint, Shiba Inu price is currently retesting a crucial support range between $0.0000128 and $0.00001, which was established in the last year. Additionally, SHIB price has been retesting a crucial support weekly trendline, which must hold to invalidate further market correction. In case of a sudden market reversal, SHIB price will be aiming for the next supply zone between $0.000021 and $0.000025. Favoring Fundamentals Shiba Inu has, over the years of existence, evolved to a utility-based memecoin through the Shibarium layer two (L2) ecosystem. The Shibarium ecosystem has grown to more than a dozen DeFi protocols, with a total value locked of about $1.71M at the time of this writing.As a result, the SHIB token has attracted more than 1.4 million on-chain holders, who have helped increase the network\u2019s overall burn rate.

Bitcoin Total Amount Of Holders Is Closing In On All-Time High According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment , the Total Amount of Holders has been rising for Bitcoin recently. The \u201c Total Amount of Holders \u201d refers to an indicator that, as its name already suggests, measures the number of BTC wallets carrying a non-zero balance. When the value of this metric rises, it can be due to several reasons. New investors joining the network and old ones who had sold earlier reinvesting into the asset can both result in an uptick for the indicator. Existing users creating multiple wallets to manage their holdings or for privacy purposes can also add to the trend. In general, it tends to be a safe assumption that all three of these would occur at once whenever the Total Amount of Holders increases. Thus, some net adoption can be considered to be occurring. On the other hand, the indicator going down implies some investors have decided to clear out their wallets, potentially because they have decided to exit from the cryptocurrency. Here is the chart shared by Santiment, which shows the trend in the Total Amount of Holders for the four top cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP and USDT. As the above graph shows, Ethereum, XRP, and USDT have been witnessing growth in their Total Amount of Holders for a while now, which means the assets have been enjoying adoption. Conversely, Bitcoin has seen chiefly consolidation in the metric during the last few months. In January, the metric set a new all-time high (ATH) of 54.72 million. Still, the metric saw a plunge shortly after, indicating that the bearish price action forced some investors to sell. Interestingly, even though the asset\u2019s volatility has continued during the last few weeks, the indicator has shown a turnaround, with its value again moving to set a new record. As the analytics firm notes, This is partially due to BTC network growth, and larger wallets splitting into smaller ones. But this does indicate continued expansion of crypto\u2019s top network, despite the nearly 8 weeks of extreme price volatility since Bitcoin\u2019s $109K price all-time high. At present, the Total Amount of Holders is sitting at 54.71 million for Bitcoin, only down 0.018% as compared to the January ATH.

Analysts view the blockchain with skepticism because of its unreliable stability according to The DeFi Report founder Michael Nadeau who calls it a \u201chouse of cards.\u201d The fees from Solana wallets during the last thirty days exceeded $74 million but 95% of this revenue originated from 1.26% of user wallets which primarily exchanged meme coins. Silence about its sustainable future exists thanks to this distribution model. Market interest in the new altcoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is intensifying because its presale demand reminds observers of Dogecoin\u2019s massive growth in 2021. Solana\u2019s Fee Boom Masks Fragility The substantial fee increases that Solana experienced due to the PumpFun platform conflict with fundamental technical deficiencies of the network. The network statistics demonstrate that speculation with meme coins dominates the system instead of practical utility functions. The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) now remains below 50 thus demonstrating decreasing purchase interest. A failure to maintain $142 value might start a liquidation cascade that could drive SOL towards $110. According to Franklin Templeton Solana maintains stable operation and decentralized finance features yet doubts remain about its capacity to expand since its user base is limited and market demand is unpredictable. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launches its third presale stage as Solana experiences volatility. This is because the platform has amassed $3.2 million from 5,500 investors. Future investors will profit through the upcoming token price increase to $0.025 because the current price stands at $0.02. Public anticipation rises about an exchange listing of MUTM tokens priced at $0.06 during Phase 4 as Phase 3 approaches its capacity fast. This upcoming price represents a potential 200% increase from its current level. Phase 3 participants stand to gain 17400% in returns once Mutuum Finance reaches its projected price of $3.50 after launch. Solana\u2019s speculative activity differs from Mutuum Finance because it utilizes decentralized lending and borrowing and mtTokens serve as collateralized deposit representations. The framework creates self-sustaining market demand through two mechanisms: first it accumulates interest from token holders then employs a token buyback program to keep lowering prices and giving tokens to staking participants. Sustainable Growth Drives Investor Confidence The presale structure of Mutuum Finance uses measures that make it available to a wide range of investors while also ensuring constant expansion. During Phase 3 investors can get access to MTokens at discounted prices which then cause price increments similar to previous DeFi launches. To encourage investment participation the project provides a $100,000 giveaway that awards $10,000 rewards to ten participants. Analysts make a direct connection between MUTM\u2019s development prospects and Dogecoin\u2019s projected 2025 market pattern because of its well-balanced economic system and practical application in the real world which creates exponential growth conditions. Timing the Market Shift The network stability issues of Solana create an opportunity for investors to consider the calculated market proposal known as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The continuing momentum of MUTM presale demonstrates the market understanding of its secure lending protocols that generate revenue from tokenomics. The Phase 3 release of MUTM presents investors with an opportunity to enter before market values rise since the project provides stability through turbulent market periods. The increasing challenges facing Solana has accelerated the trend to adopt projects which provide both utility and yield.

(a thread) pic.twitter.com/QlQYU65AZT \u2014 The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) March 13, 2025 This intentional tanking of markets may be driven by several factors, such as a record government deficit reaching $1.15 trillion in February, a desire to lower oil prices, plans to reduce the US trade deficit through tariffs, and a goal to cut government jobs that have accounted for recent job growth. Trump\u2019s economic weakness plans appear to have several goals, including lowering inflation (currently 2.8%), oil prices, and interest rates. He also aims to reduce deficit spending, trade deficits, and government inefficiency. Economist Joe Foudy told Newsweek that this is a \u201cpolitical recognition\u201d before adding: \u201cIf the stock market responds negatively or if we see weaker economic data, Trump needs to get ahead of the narrative. By framing short-term economic downturns as necessary for long-term gains, he is managing expectations.\u201d \u201cNormally, the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates to stabilize the economy. But if tariffs drive up prices, policymakers may hesitate, fearing rate cuts could fuel inflation,\u201d commented NYU economics professor Lawrence White. Trump is clearly telling his plans. He doesn\u2019t care about the stock market or the crypto market. All he cares about is that interest rates to go down which will definitely cause some short-term pain.

As traditional markets experience downturns, investors may reduce exposure to high-risk assets like crypto to cover losses elsewhere or move to cash positions, more so if interest rates increase again. Market instability could also lead to liquidity issues in crypto markets, potentially causing exaggerated price movements. Crypto might continue following stock market trends in the short term.\u00a0The market has already declined by around 25% over the past couple of months as $1 trillion has left the space. In the long term, lowering interest rates could eventually benefit it as an alternative investment when cheap money looks for yields. Moreover, economic instability might accelerate crypto regulation efforts, which could provide clarity and potentially attract more institutional adoption. If the strategy affects dollar strength, which has weakened recently , cryptocurrencies could benefit as alternatives to fiat currencies. Over time, crypto markets could gradually decouple from traditional markets as the sector matures and establishes its own economic cycles, however there is likely to be more pain before any gains.

Journalist and host of the America In Crypto podcast Eleanor Terrett recently revealed that the only hurdles left are the $125 million penalty and the permanent injunction from the court that prevents Ripple from selling tokens to institutional investors. However, Yassin Mobarak, founder of Dizer Capital, believes that Ripple\u2019s primary concern is the permanent injunction, as the company can easily pay the $125 million penalty. This restriction from the injunction has significant implications for Ripple\u2019s business operations. Cancelling the $125M Ripple fine is not the problem. Ripple can pay that without blinking. The issue is the injunction preventing Ripple from selling XRP to institutional investors. That is the big deal. Ripple is negotiating to have that injunction removed somehow. I'm not a\u2026 https://t.co/pLloUkjw2K \u2014 Yassin Mobarak (@Dizer_YM) March 12, 2025 The SEC has spent the past few weeks dismissing other crypto-related lawsuits and investigations. Mobarak believes the lawsuit resolution is being delayed because the company is negotiating the removal of this injunction. He called on prominent legal experts in the crypto space to explain better, as he is unsure how Ripple can achieve this goal. Legal Experts Weigh In Legal experts have provided insight into ways Ripple might address this issue. Attorney Bill Morgan clarified that Ripple is not attempting to remove the injunction outright but is negotiating for the SEC to consent to a motion requesting the judge to vacate it. However, this outcome is not guaranteed even with the SEC\u2019s consent. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 \u2014 TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 MetaLawMan, another well-respected attorney, also recently weighed in on Ripple\u2019s strategy, suggesting that the company might negotiate with the SEC to alter or remove parts of Judge Torres\u2019 decision. While the ruling was favorable for XRP holders, the findings of securities law violations and the injunction created complications for Ripple. MetaLawMan speculated that the SEC would have accepted a straightforward settlement involving both parties dismissing their appeals and Ripple paying the penalty. However, Ripple appears to be pushing for a better deal. Attorney Jeremy Hogan also reacted to the potential resolution after Terrett\u2019s initial report. He noted that the case could conclude soon if Ripple and the SEC reach a private settlement that does not require court approval. However, he questioned whether the SEC would agree to a settlement that effectively bypasses the injunction. He proposed an alternative scenario where the SEC might allow Ripple a regulatory path to register sales of XRP to institutional investors. The Path Forward The resolution of the Ripple lawsuit depends on whether the SEC is willing to negotiate the injunction terms. If the SEC maintains its position, Ripple\u2019s options become limited. However, the regulator has displayed a more pro-crypto stance since the change in administration, and the final decision to vacate the injunction may lie in the hands of the court.

Creators could launch meme tokens and then use livestreaming events to get more users to buy the tokens and drive the prices up in real-time. This concept isn\u2019t exactly novel as e-commerce platforms in countries like China employ similar sales strategies to better demo their products. However, the reality was different from the vision thanks to a lack of content moderation, which is not exactly a staple of the crypto industry. The livestream feature became an arena for harmful content, with users streaming racist, pornographic, and other abusive materials, such as animal abuse and threats to commit bodily harm to themselves and their family members, all in a bid to get more users to buy their memecoins. The series of events caused widespread backlash and forced one of Pump.fun\u2019s founders, Alon Cohen, to announce that it will shut down the livestream feature while they find modern ways to tackle video content moderation. Messaging to the rescue? Following the unfortunate end of the livestream feature, it seems Pump.fun has shifted its focus to DMs and group messaging as one of the tools for community engagement on the platform. It\u2019s also a welcome development as it gives the platform more control over content moderation. However, it doesn\u2019t totally insulate the feature from being abused again. There\u2019s the existential tendency of people trying to do extreme things to court attention for their memecoin launches. It\u2019s just too early to determine how the messaging features will be used. According to speculators, this may also be a chance for Pump.fun to redeem itself from the livestreaming debacle and also get more activity on the platform which has recorded a decline in activity compared to it\u2019s meteoric rise last year. Upon the announcement of the indefinite closure of its livestreaming feature, activities on Pump.fun reportedly dropped by 50% late last year. It saw a temporary uptick earlier in January, but it has been down badly after memecoins such as LIBRA and TRUMP caused tremendous losses to holders despite being heavily supported by leading political figures like Javier Milei and Donald Trump, respectively. Pump.fun has had an eventful year in the memecoin space Despite recent setbacks, Pump.fun remains a dominant player in the memecoin market. Pump.fun launched with lots of promise in January of 2024, and it was responsible for over 70% of the memecoins launched on the Solana blockchain at some point last year. For its creators, Pump.fun has been a lucrative venture as they get to charge a 1% trading fee as well as SOL charges for memecoins that satisfy its criteria to move into larger exchanges. The memecoin launchpad also rakes in large amounts in trading fees, reaching as high as $15 million at its peak. However, Pump.fun\u2019s journey hasn\u2019t exactly been smooth this year as it currently faces a series of class action lawsuits in the United States. In December 2024, the United Kingdom\u2019s financial authority, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), warned the public that Pump.fun isn\u2019t authorized to operate in the country, leading to Pump.fun restricting access to its platform to users in the UK. The restriction means UK users still cannot access the memecoin launchpad and its new messaging feature. Adding to Pump.fun\u2019s troubles, its official X account was recently hacked, with attackers promoting fraudulent tokens. As expected, the new messaging feature was received with mixed feelings by Pump.fun\u2019s community. Some users are skeptical, while others are more receptive. One user on X (@0xKaco) said, \u201cPump fun has always been a social platform 1st and a trading platform 2nd,\u201d with another user highlighting concerns from the livestream mishap and asking if no one will be harassed or sent slurs for selling. Despite all the speculations, some users are already testing the new feature and announcing their new group chats on X. The coming months will be a determinant for many users and speculators of the platform if the new feature is a better upgrade or carry on with the legacy of the livestreaming feature.

However, it has temporarily stopped bearish due to a bounce and regained strength with notable gains in the past 24 hours. Since last week, KAS has seen a major move as trading levels change to the downside. This came with a monthly breakdown, and the price fell to a new multi-month low of $0.0557. It recovered briefly from the low to retest the recently broken support as resistance and now faces rejection. As a result, the price is weak, following a 2% loss. A further loss could bring selling pressure back into the market. This could later lead to another breakdown capable of plunging the price into the $0.04 range. If the price recovers higher, it may revisit the $0.09 level before losing grip. As of now, there are no signs of strong commitment from the bulls\u2019 side, as the demand level appears low. The only condition for a trend shift lies in a significant increase above the previous monthly low. But from the looks of things, KAS has shown no signs of slowing down yet. Having said that, the overall market is still considered bearish in the mid-term. More selling actions should be expected sooner than later. KAS\u2019s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The $0.076 resistance level is posing a threat. If the price increases above it, the $0.095 level would be the next resistance to keep an eye on, along with $0.1143. The higher levels for a trend shift are $0.135 and $0.155.

Bitcoin closed February below $92,000. That happened. There\u2019s nothing else to wait for. So far, March has found resistance there.

US CPI (Consumer Price Index) came in lower than forecast after some hot January numbers, so most likely some relief from risk assets.

After raising over $1.6 million during its presale, this decentralized e-commerce platform is now set on a clear path to becoming fully operational by the year\u2019s end. The team behind Web3Bay isn\u2019t just looking at short-term gains; they\u2019re building something long-lasting and community-centered. By transitioning into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), Web3Bay will ensure its users\u2014not a centralized group\u2014hold the real power. This is a significant step, transforming how people buy and sell online. The move to decentralization and user control isn\u2019t just innovative; it\u2019s practical. Web3Bay is creating a marketplace that puts the community in charge, offering a new way to shop securely and efficiently. Presale Momentum Sets the Stage The Web3Bay presale has been nothing short of impressive, hitting over $1.6 million and counting. With more than 400 million 3BAY tokens already sold, the marketplace is seeing strong interest from both casual buyers and bigger players. Each presale stage pushes the token price higher, now sitting at $0.005247. But there\u2019s more excitement ahead: the planned launch price is $0.1959, giving early backers a possible return of up to 6430%. This structured presale method, spread across 28 stages, shows that Web3Bay is serious about steady growth. Every new stage bumps the price by 15%, rewarding those who got in early and creating momentum that keeps newcomers engaged. This approach isn\u2019t just good marketing\u2014it shows clear direction and confidence. People see Web3Bay as a serious network capable of delivering long-term results. Moving from Beta to Fully Decentralized Web3Bay isn\u2019t content to remain just another marketplace. The next step is moving from beta into a fully decentralized system. By late 2025, Web3Bay aims to become completely decentralized, meaning the platform won\u2019t rely on any central management team. Instead, it will run entirely through smart contracts and peer-to-peer transactions. This is a major shift from how e-commerce works today, where big companies and intermediaries typically take control. One key feature that will help Web3Bay achieve this decentralization is the integration of smart contract escrow systems. This setup protects buyers and sellers equally, ensuring trust without relying on third-party intermediaries. Additionally, the team plans to expand its payment options to include cryptocurrencies and traditional payment methods, like PayPal, to appeal to the widest possible audience. By removing middlemen and unnecessary fees, Web3Bay is creating a more affordable, fairer trading environment. DAO: Power to the Users Perhaps the most exciting part of Web3Bay\u2019s future is its planned transition into a DAO in Q3 2025. A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, means the platform\u2019s users will directly control key decisions about Web3Bay\u2019s operations, fees, upgrades, and policies. Users who hold 3BAY tokens will vote on major changes, shaping the direction of the marketplace. This user governance isn\u2019t just symbolic; it has practical benefits. When users have a direct say in decision-making, the platform adapts faster to community needs. It becomes responsive, transparent, and more attractive for long-term growth. The DAO structure also helps build a loyal user base since people feel they have genuine control and ownership. This democratic, community-driven approach separates Web3Bay from other marketplaces, ensuring the platform\u2019s long-term success. Future Innovations: NFTs and DeFi Integration Web3Bay\u2019s vision goes beyond decentralization and community governance. In late 2025, the marketplace intends to expand further into NFT-based commerce, allowing people to trade goods represented by NFTs. This integration will open new business opportunities, such as selling digital goods, exclusive items, and even collectibles through verified ownership. With NFTs becoming increasingly popular, Web3Bay is tapping into a growing demand, ensuring the marketplace stays relevant. On top of NFT trading, Web3Bay will introduce decentralized finance (DeFi) features, including staking and yield farming, offering extra incentives for users to hold onto their tokens. Staking will reward token holders directly, helping them generate passive income, while DeFi services create even more reasons for people to stay engaged with the platform. These innovations reinforce Web3Bay\u2019s long-term vision, turning a simple marketplace into a full-scale ecosystem of financial and commercial activities. A Community-Driven Future Ahead Web3Bay\u2019s roadmap clearly signals that the team knows exactly where it\u2019s headed. The platform\u2019s journey from its current beta stage toward a fully operational DAO-powered marketplace by the end of 2025 highlights ambition, careful planning, and strong community focus. After a successful presale that captured significant attention, Web3Bay is now set to implement exciting developments that promise to transform how people shop online. From decentralizing control and introducing user governance through a DAO, to integrating NFTs and advanced DeFi tools, Web3Bay offers something special: a marketplace genuinely powered by its community. Users won\u2019t just be passive participants but active decision-makers shaping the platform\u2019s future. If Web3Bay delivers on this promise, it won\u2019t just redefine online commerce\u2014it\u2019ll become the benchmark for how decentralized marketplaces should operate.

A breakout of this pattern could trigger a major trend shift. The sharp bounce off the $2.35 level brought a substantial recovery in TIA\u2019s price during last month\u2019s trading, but it was short-lived under $4.5, and the price fell. This triggered a violent drop earlier this month, and the price rolled back amid rising supply throughout last week. This time, the $2.6 level produced support and the crypto-asset increased suddenly to $3.8 yesterday. It faced rejection and dropped to around $3.5 at the time of writing. The price remains strong, but things may go south if it continues to face rejection. A weekly close above the rejected monthly high should validate a slight shift in the trend before rallying hard to the top. Failure to close above this high could result in another drop with a potential breakdown. Another bullish indicator to pay attention to is the double-bottom pattern on the daily chart.

The project\u2019s tokenomics structure ensures that 30% of Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) directly benefits token holders. Half of this allocation supports strategic buybacks and burns, reducing supply over time, while the other half is distributed as staking rewards. With this model in place, BitLemons creates an ecosystem that supports sustainable long-term value. BitLemons has also secured dual security audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof, reinforcing confidence in the platform. The presale has been moving quickly, with Stage 1 selling out in just 16 days. Stage 2 is now nearly complete, with only a limited amount of $BLEM remaining before the price increases from $0.02 to $0.03. Additionally, strong speculation suggests that high-profile endorsements and influencer partnerships may soon be announced, adding even more momentum to this rapidly growing project. PI Gains Interest with Upcoming Announcements Pi Network\u2019s PI token has seen growing attention as traders speculate on its potential Binance listing and the upcoming Pi Day announcements on March 14. The growing anticipation surrounding these developments has driven increased trading activity, with many looking to secure positions ahead of key updates. Additionally, the approaching deadline for Know Your Customer (KYC) verification and the migration of PI holdings to the mainnet has further contributed to market interest. Despite the optimism, there are factors to consider. The protocol is set to unlock 188 million PI tokens, which could introduce selling pressure into the market. While speculation is high, investors are watching closely to see whether PI can maintain its current momentum once these tokens become available. TRX Sees Uncertainty with Large Transfers TRON\u2019s TRX token is navigating a period of uncertainty following the movement of 629,967,847 TRX\u2014worth approximately $139.5 million\u2014between unknown wallets. A similar large transfer of 264,073,539 TRX was also recorded, leading to speculation about whale activity and potential strategic shifts among major holders. At the moment, TRX is seeing mixed sentiment as market participants assess the impact of these transactions. Large movements like these can often signal upcoming volatility, prompting investors to remain cautious. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether TRX stabilizes or faces further shifts in price direction. $BLEM Delivers Real Results Unlike Pi Network and TRON, which are currently dealing with speculation and market-related uncertainty, BitLemons operates on a revenue-driven model that generates real, consistent earnings. Its active gaming platform provides a steady income stream, making it less dependent on market trends. The deflationary nature of its tokenomics ensures that as the platform scales, the value of $BLEM continues to grow. With a rapidly expanding community and growing adoption, BitLemons is attracting attention from both retail investors and institutional players interested in the gaming sector. As major gaming companies explore crypto integrations, BitLemons is positioning itself as a key player in this evolving landscape. With the presale nearing its next price increase, those looking to invest early have a limited window to do so before $BLEM\u2019s valuation rises further. The current pace of adoption suggests that demand will only grow stronger in the coming weeks. The opportunity is now. Will you seize it?

Following a notable surge from its recent low, it appeared strong daily while undergoing a retracement. Looking back, Pepe has shed a lot of loss in the past weeks as the price broke through several support levels to reach a year low of $0.0000052 on Tuesday. This came following a recent dump from $0.0000089. Luckily for the bulls, the low level held as support after an interception and the price bounced back. Reiterating actions yesterday, they managed to close the price an inch above $0.000007 with an engulfing bullish bar. This indicates strong volume inflow in the last 48 hours, and as we can see, the price looks strong on the day despite seeing a slight rejection. If the market further shows strength, Pepe may retest the monthly high, where it initiated a dump earlier this month. Scaling through this high could activate a retracement towards $0.000014 before rolling back. A continuous rejection under this high could result in another leg down, capable of dipping the price to a new yearly low. While it remains under the bears\u2019 radar, it currently leads the daily altcoins gains following a steady recovery since Tuesday. Pepe\u2019s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Pushing higher, the immediate hurdles for the bulls lie at $0.000089 \u2013 marked at the monthly high. A successful surge above it should send the price to $0.0000114 and $0.0000147 in a retracement phase. If the meme coin loses grip, there\u2019s minor support at $0.0000065, while $0.00000526 stands as support.

The bears appear set to mount pressure again as supply slowly increases. It looks weak following a 3% loss in the past hours. DOT\u2019s daily outlook remains weak following a roller-coaster reduction in the last three months. Bears have fully taken control in the short term. The early month dump has not just caused panic and fear for the mid-term investors but has put DOT in a more bearish condition over the past few days, and from the look of things, it is not showing signs of slowing down yet. It just resumed selling after taking a day break. The weekly $3.65 low may pose a little threat as the bears slowly mount pressure. A pull-off this low could dip the price to a new multi-year low. Such a dip will bring an end to the bull season and, at the same time, trigger a long-term bearish sentiment. Another pointer to watch for this bearish signal is the steady decline in the daily volume indicator. We may see a short retracement if the bulls defend the weekly low well.

His latest analysis, which was first shared with subscribers on February 12, 2025, outlines potential price targets for XRP based on historical patterns and technical indicators. Egrag begins his thread by emphasizing the importance of using multiple indicators, stating, \u201cTo improve our chances of hitting our targets, we need to use multiple indicators, charts, and patterns. The more signals we collect, the better our odds of success!\u201d He then presents a structured Elliott Wave count to assess XRP\u2019s next potential price levels. #XRP = Thread (1/7) #XRP : Double Digits This Cycle, Triple Digits Next! The thread below about #XRP was shared in the Subscribers section on February 12, 2025. We\u2019ve built together the Full Elliot Wave Count to assess our next Targets: Take an in-depth look at it! \u2026 pic.twitter.com/NKv00Y5MZD \u2014 EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) March 12, 2025 Current Market Position and Initial Projections Egrag identifies a key formation within XRP\u2019s price structure, referring to it as the \u201cJUST-DO-IT CHART.\u201d According to the analyst, \u201cThe measured move of the cup pattern (or wave) has formed well within the arc. After the breakout, we confirmed that the pattern is unfolding just as we expected.\u201d This formation suggests that XRP is in the process of setting up for a major price movement. Regarding a potential price target, Egrag states, \u201cIt looks like we could be aiming for around $13.\u201d He stresses the reliability of chart-based analysis, remarking, \u201cMen lie, women lie, but charts don\u2019t lie!\u201d Elliott Wave Count and Expected Movements Egrag outlines the fundamental principles of the Elliott Wave theory, explaining how different waves follow predictable patterns. He specifies that \u201cWave 2 usually retraces 50%, 61.8%, 76.4%, or 85.4% of Wave 1,\u201d while \u201cWave 3 typically extends to 161.8% of Wave 1.\u201d These calculations form the basis for his projected XRP price movements. At the current stage, Egrag believes XRP is in Wave 2, which is typically a corrective phase before the strongest move in Wave 3. \u201cWave 1 has increased by 733%. Right now, we\u2019re confirming that we\u2019re in Wave 2. However, I believe we might see a double bottom before completing Wave 2,\u201d he explains. Looking forward, he estimates Wave 3 will experience a significant increase. He calculates, \u201cFor Wave 3, we take Wave 1\u2019s 733% and multiply it by 1.618. This gives us a projected 1,185% increase for Wave 3.\u201d If this happens, XRP\u2019s price could rise to around $22 to $24. After Wave 3 peaks, Wave 4 is expected to retrace, with Egrag considering a \u201cworst-case scenario of a 38.2% retracement.\u201d This would lead to a temporary price drop to around $8. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 \u2014 TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Wave 5 and Long-Term XRP Price Potential For the final wave in the Elliott Wave cycle , Egrag provides three different methods to estimate XRP\u2019s potential price target. One approach considers the inverse of 1.236% to 1.618% of Wave 4, which could result in XRP reaching between $32 and $48. Another method assumes that Wave 5 will match the size of Wave 1, leading to a projected price range of $60 to $70. A third calculation, based on 61.8% of the combined moves of Waves 1 and 3, suggests that XRP could climb as high as $100. These projections indicate the potential for XRP to reach triple-digit values in the longer term. Comparison to the 2017 Fractal Egrag compares the current market cycle and the XRP price movement observed in 2017. He believes the similarities between the two periods strengthen the case for a major price rally. In his comparison, Egrag highlights that: Wave 1 and Wave 2 align closely with the 2017 pattern, though the latter had a deeper correction. Wave 3 could reach between $17 and $24, in line with previous price action. Wave 4 could retrace to around $8, though a more bearish scenario might see a drop to $3.40. In the 2017 cycle, Wave 5 saw XRP surpass $100 . In his current model, Egrag identifies potential Wave 5 targets of $32\u2013$48, $60\u2013$70, and $95\u2013$110. using Elliott Wave theory, Egrag Crypto\u2019s latest analysis comprehensively breaks down XRP\u2019s potential price movements. His projections indicate that XRP could reach double digits in the current cycle and climb to triple digits in the next. While market conditions and external factors will play a role, his analysis suggests that XRP remains positioned for significant long-term growth.

The cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing a slump, with Bitcoin and Ethereum trading below $82k and $2k respectively. One of the major catalysts, according to Lunardi, is the anticipated regulatory clarity from the Trump Administration. On the Milk Road podcast, he said that the administration\u2019s forthcoming policies on compliant tokens will likely unlock substantial investment, particularly from institutional investors. \u201cWe\u2019re about to see clear regulatory guidelines on what it means to have a compliant token, which will reduce risks and encourage more institutional capital to flow into the market,\u201d Lunardi said. Lunardi also pointed to the fading prominence of meme coins as a bullish indicator. While many have seen the decline of meme coins as a sign of a bear market, Lunardi views it as a positive shift, suggesting that liquidity from meme coins will likely be reallocated into more established altcoins, potentially benefiting diverse crypto portfolios. Furthermore, Lunardi said that institutional capital inflows and the rise of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will provide significant support to the market, helping to stabilize prices and facilitate broader crypto adoption. \u201cThe infrastructure for institutional capital is in place, with more ETFs opening up the market,\u201d he explained. He explained that his main focus is on Bitcoin, and he remains bullish on Solana as well, despite the current popularity of meme coins. He also mentioned that he believes the Trump Administration will pay special attention to U.S.-based cryptocurrencies, particularly those that have utility and real-world applications. Despite his bullish outlook, Lunardi acknowledged the potential challenges posed by macroeconomic factors, such as tariffs and inflation. He warned that global economic uncertainties could still impact the crypto market in the short term, particularly if tariffs escalate and inflation remains high.", "published_on": "2025-03-14T14:32:10", "url": "https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-news-trump-administration-set-to-focus-on-u-s-based-altcoins-expert-reveals-bullish-outlook/", "source": "coinpedia", "categories": ["TRADING", "ALTCOIN", "MARKET", "BTC", "BUSINESS"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.16087065233616957, "subjectivity": 0.47868562472010756, "sentiment": "positive"}, "entities": ["bitcoin", "ethereum", "solana"], "topics": ["lunardi", "administration", "trump", "institutional", "meme"]}, {"id": "41631144", "title": "Crypto Pundit Claims XRP Will Hit $1,000 \u2013 Here\u2019s The 10 Reasons Why", "body": "In a new video, CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii)\u2014the founder of the Cryptonairz community\u2014laid out a comprehensive argument for why he believes XRP could soar to four- and even five-digit price territory. The video, titled \u201cTHIS WILL GUARANTEE A $1000 XRP PRICE,\u201d focuses on ten key factors that, according to CryptoSensei, could significantly boost XRP\u2019s adoption and market valuation in the coming years. #1 Regulatory Clarity For XRP CryptoSensei begins by underscoring the ongoing legal situation involving the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs, mentioning the partial appeal of the court\u2019s July 2023 ruling. While stressing that the appeal does not designate XRP itself as a security, he notes that \u201cwe still have the case against Brad and Chris [referring to Ripple executives] going.\u201d The resolution of these legal hurdles, he argues, is crucial for broader institutional adoption within the United States. \u201cIf we want the type of movement we\u2019re looking for inside the US, we need those things to come to an end,\u201d CryptoSensei says, alluding to the potential for major banks like Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and BNY Mellon to officially engage with XRP once regulatory clarity is achieved. #2 Institutions Standing By To Use XRP The video highlights a series of statements from major financial institutions, including the CEO of BNY Mellon, who indicated that crypto custody and tokenized assets are among the bank\u2019s future priorities. According to CryptoSensei, banks are \u201cready to jump in,\u201d but are hesitant to make large-scale commitments without clear regulatory guidelines. He emphasizes that if XRP were to host \u201ceven 5 or 10%\u201d of a multi-trillion-dollar global tokenization market, the price could reach four- or five-digit figures. #3 Potential SEC Case Drops A noteworthy discussion point is the SEC\u2019s recent trend of dropping cases (or opting not to pursue them) against certain crypto firms. CryptoSensei mentions that the Commission \u201cdropped the case against OpenSea, Coinbase, [and] Robinhood,\u201d suggesting a possible shift in enforcement strategy. \u201cIs Ripple, in fact, next? \u2026 If the [former] Trump administration wants to stand by their word of working with the crypto industry and not against them, I do believe this is coming,\u201d he posits. #4 Tokenization Of Real-World Assets (RWAs) Central to CryptoSensei\u2019s thesis is the growing trend of tokenizing traditional assets\u2014ranging from real estate to debt instruments\u2014on blockchain networks. He cites Ripple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz, who says the XRP Ledger (XRPL) could be \u201ca really good platform\u201d for these tokenization projects, thanks to its low fees, integrated decentralized exchange (DEX), and multi-asset support. Schwartz explained: \u201cIf someone\u2019s going to buy or sell tokenized real-world assets, they want to be able to do that with whatever asset is convenient for them.\u201d CryptoSensei further highlights how Robinhood\u2019s documentation from January 2025 (mentioned in the video) cites Ripple\u2019s success in tokenizing hundreds of millions of dollars in real-world assets on the XRPL\u2014projects that aim to expand into the billions and eventually trillions. #5 Interoperability Bridges Another critical piece is interoperability. CryptoSensei references the Axelar network, which is bridging the XRPL mainnet, the XRP Ledger EVM sidechain, and over 55 other blockchains. The expansion of cross-chain liquidity is described as \u201cliquidity, liquidity, liquidity.\u201d He points out that the XRPL\u2019s design\u2014integrating DEX functionality directly into the protocol\u2014simplifies asset swaps and liquidity provisioning, boosting its appeal for large-scale tokenization. #6 Cross-Border Payment Solutions Ripple\u2019s long-standing focus on remittances and cross-border payments also features prominently. CryptoSensei shows a clip describing how a US-to-Mexico corridor, facilitated by XRP, can settle in mere minutes at a fraction of legacy fees. \u201cAll of that takes about 10 minutes, which used to be three days,\u201d says a Ripple spokesperson in the included clip, also noting that these transactions can be up to \u201c20-odd basis points cheaper.\u201d He argues that such improvements in speed and cost will eventually outcompete outdated correspondent banking rails, potentially capturing a significant portion of the multi-billion-dollar global remittance market. #7 Collaborations With Key Global Institutions In the video, CryptoSensei showcases the Bank for International Settlements\u2019 (BIS) Cross-Border Payments Interoperability and Extension Task Force, listing Ripple alongside only a handful of major international payment networks\u2014such as Mastercard, SWIFT, and EBA Clearing. He emphasizes Ripple\u2019s unique position as the only blockchain infrastructure provider on the roster, describing it as a testament to the company\u2019s significance in shaping next-generation payment standards. #8 Treasury Market On XRP Ledger Referencing Ondo\u2019s tokenization initiatives, CryptoSensei highlights the possibility of US Treasuries migrating onto blockchains, potentially including the XRP Ledger. He notes the US Treasury market alone stands at over $28 trillion, while globally, the bond market encompasses roughly $130 trillion. \u201cCould you imagine five or ten trillion dollars finding its way onto the XRP Ledger over the next five to ten years?\u201d he asks, suggesting even a fraction of that capital would profoundly affect XRP\u2019s valuation. #9 Derivatives Expansion According to the video, derivatives\u2014often said to represent notional values in the hundreds of trillions to over a quadrillion dollars\u2014are a prime target for on-chain tokenization. CryptoSensei points to Bitstamp, which is building a derivatives exchange on the XRPL. He believes that capturing a slice of these massive markets could drive significant demand for XRP, especially if large holders lock up tokens for long-term liquidity provisioning. #10 Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) Finally, the pundit underscores Ripple\u2019s work with various central banks on CBDC pilots. He cites projects under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and notes that Ripple was recently named the top technology provider for CBDCs by Juniper Research. From the Bank of International Settlements to major economies in Asia, CryptoSensei posits that the institutional relationships Ripple has forged place XRP in a strategic position to bridge disparate currencies and networks. \u201cRipple is working with up to 30 central banks,\u201d he states, emphasizing that these ongoing partnerships may open doors for XRP to serve as a liquidity tool in sovereign-level digital currencies. While some of the claims\u2014such as XRP reaching \u201cfour or five digits\u201d\u2014are extremely bullish and hinge on multiple converging factors, CryptoSensei remains steadfast: if even a few of these catalysts unfold in Ripple\u2019s favor, he envisions a drastically higher valuation for XRP. Throughout the video, he stresses that regulatory clarity in the United States is the linchpin to unlocking widespread adoption. \u201cIf all of these things happen,\u201d he concludes, \u201cyou better believe we\u2019re looking at a four to five digit price.\u201d At press time, XRP traded at $2.31.

As one of the top altcoins, price action often moves the entire crypto market. This is happening when memecoins like Pepe (PEPE) and DuragDoge ($DURAG) are still hot. If XRP breaks out it will bring in more liquidity and speculation across the altcoin space. Memecoins, known for their volatility and hype driven rallies, will see huge gains as traders rotate into them. Let\u2019s get into what\u2019s driving the impending XRP breakout and its impact on PEPE and DuragDoge. Ripple (XRP): On the Verge of Massive Breakout Amid SEC Challenges XRP moved recently after what seemed like an eternity of sideways grinding. Even experienced traders might become confused when an asset moves in such a manner. The problem is that experienced chart observers look at more than price movement. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), which they are tracking, currently provides an intriguing narrative. According to a new perspective from Matrixport, a well-known brand in digital asset management, an RSI hovering around 40% is frequently an indication that a rally may be about to begin. And you know what? The value of XRP is hovering around that threshold. However, Matrixport\u2019s analysts believe that the SEC v. Ripple legal dispute will continue to dominate XRP\u2019s future. The financial watchdog recently deleted the civil lawsuits it had filed against the cryptocurrency startup from its database. The long-running lawsuit may be coming to a close, or at the very least, it may be revisited, according to several members of the XRP community. Pepe (PEPE): Good Time to Invest or Hold Off? Pepe Coin has acquired significant traction in the memecoin market as one of the top altcoins. Unlike other memecoins, Pepe coin started as an entertaining online culture driven project. The coin is highly influenced by meme culture, which, as we all know, is the reason why so many cryptocurrencies are popular today. When the price of Pepe rose significantly, serious investors and crypto enthusiasts paid attention to it; wondering how far this meme could stretch. The upcoming breakout of XRP stands a chance of positively affecting memecoins such as Pepe. It is clear from Pepecoin\u2019s price nowadays that the coin has done well, but the question is, will its price continue to rise? Market trends, active members within the community, and memes that serve as advertisement influence the price of Pepe Coin significantly. Because of the coin\u2019s vast and loyal following, analysts believe Pepe\u2019s price might have a good few months ahead of it. DuragDoge ($DURAG): The Ultimate Memecoin with Style and Swagger People understand that anytime a cryptocurrency with a large market size, for instance XRP, experiences a breakout, this means new liquidity is available in the market. Seeing profits from XRP, investors can reinvest into high-potential altcoins, including memecoins like $DURAG. This new money can increase trading volume and therefore set price appreciation for the token. DuragDoge is not a copycat, it\u2019s the rush of street life and the fun of memecoin. The project promises to rewrite the script and bring something new and real even as it acknowledges the meme currency market is full of copycats and overhyped promises. The objective is to create a community driven by the drip, driven by aspiration, and powered by cryptocurrency. Known as a swagger coin, DuragDoge is designed for the street to reward people who \u201cwork hard, show off, and don\u2019t hesitate to take risks.\u201d With $DURAG as its badge of honour, the initiative keeps true to this narrative by building a bold, inventive community that always shows off the hustle. For those who believe in their glow up, Durag Doge is a lifestyle, a silky durag and powered by the hood\u2019s energy, street smarts and swag. Analysts say it\u2019s one of the high-potential altcoins set for growth sooner than expected. Conclusion XRP is about to make a big move and its breakout will trigger a dominos effect in the altcoin market. Memecoins like PEPE and $DURAG will benefit if liquidity and speculation increases. PEPE and $DURAG will ride this wave and moon as traders look for the next big moonshot. Follow Durag Doge on X and Telegram for the latest news and updates.

The notable bleeding of major stock indexes has trickled down into the crypto market, as Bitcoin price slipped from trading above $101k to around $82k on Thursday, March 13, during the early New York trading session. The altcoin market has recorded the highest losses in the past few months, led by Ethereum (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE). As a result, the question lingering in most crypto traders is when and if an altseason will happen in 2025. Altseason 2025 Key Insights From historical data, the altcoin season has been kickstarted by the reversal of the macro Bitcoin dominance. However, the introduction of spot crypto ETFs has significantly disrupted the historical crypto cash rotation, thus complicating the expected timeline of the altseason 2025. From a technical analysis perspective, the Others/BTC pair in the weekly timeframe is currently retesting a crucial support level, which in the past cycles yielded parabolic altseason. However, the altseason will be delayed if the altcoin market fails to rebound from the current levels in the coming weeks. #Altseason is Ready To Go $Total 2 is showing the same ready-to-go pattern for Altseason.

However, the administration change in the United States under President Donald Trump, which has significantly focused on providing clear crypto regulations, has favored a rejuvenated mainstream adoption of digital assets , led by DeFi tokens. The launch of the Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin has heavily democratized the adoption of crypto assets by retail and institutional investors. Considering all the factors, top altcoins to keep a close watch on in the anticipated altseason include the heavily oversold tokens, especially those with robust leadership and a supportive online community. For instance, Shiba Inu (SHIB), Notcoin (NOT), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), PancakeSwap (CAKE), and Uniswap (UNI). .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Chief Judge John Dorsey rejected FTX\u2019s debtors\u2019 argument that the amended proof of claim (POC) from 3AC liquidators was untimely and an unjust attempt to slow the bankruptcy proceedings. In a March 13 ruling in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, Dorsey opined that 3AC liquidators had provided sufficient notice of their claim and the possibility of amending it once they had analyzed all the available information. Any delay, he said, was caused by FTX\u2019s failure to share relevant records promptly. Chief Judge John Dorsey has granted the motion by liquidators for defunct hedge fund Three Arrows Capital to increase their claim against FTX to $1.53 billion. Source: \u201cThe evidence suggests that the delay in filing the Amended Proof of Claim was, in large part, caused by the Debtors themselves,\u201d Dorsey said. \u201cThe evidence also suggests that the Liquidators were diligent in attempting to obtain the information and that despite having the complete information in their possession, the Debtors repeatedly delayed giving it to them.\u201d 3AC liquidators initially filed a $120 million claim in FTX\u2019s bankruptcy case in June 2023. They later expanded it in November 2024 , alleging claims including breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and breach of fiduciary duty. The liquidators alleged FTX held $1.53 billion in the hedge fund assets that were liquidated to settle $1.33 billion in liabilities in 2022. They argued that the transactions were avoidable, caused harm to 3AC creditors and that FTX debtors had delayed providing the information that would have uncovered the liquidation. FTX debtors objected to the amended claim, saying that the original POC was insufficient to inform them about the nature and amount 3AC liquidators would be claiming and that it came too late and should be disallowed. Related: FTX filed for bankruptcy 2 years ago \u2014 What\u2019s happening now? Before its collapse in June 2022 , Three Arrows Capital was once one of the industry\u2019s largest crypto hedge funds, with over $3 billion in assets. Its liquidators also pursued claims against collapsed crypto firm Terraform Labs through a $1.3 billion claim in Terra\u2019s bankruptcy case. At the same time, FTX, which filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, has been undertaking its own recovery efforts to reclaim funds. In November last year, it filed a trio of lawsuits, one against SkyBridge Capital and its founder, Anthony Scaramucci, to recoup funds spent by former FTX CEO Sam \u201cSBF\u201d Bankman-Fried on sponsorship and investment deals. Another suit was filed against crypto exchange Binance and its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao , to recover $1.76 billion worth of cryptocurrency sent to the exchange as part of a July 2021 repurchase deal.

Here\u2019s why", "body": "A financial expert has argued that institutions would expand their crypto investment strategies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum by adding XRP ETFs to their portfolios. This perspective follows Franklin Templeton\u2019s recent filing for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) , bringing the total number of proposed XRP ETFs to 15. Linda P. Jones, author of the finance book, \u201c3 Steps to Quantum Wealth\u201d emphasized this shift, suggesting that institutional investors will look beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum as market dynamics evolve. She contends that recent market trends, including XRP\u2019s strong performance relative to Bitcoin and Ethereum, indicate growing interest in the asset. A Record Number of XRP ETF Filings Franklin Templeton\u2019s move to file for an XRP ETF has set a new benchmark, with XRP now leading all other cryptocurrencies in ETF filings. The total of 15 proposed XRP ETFs surpasses the number of filings for Bitcoin, which stands at 11, and Ethereum, which has seen only 8 filings. Some see the surge in ETF applications as an indication of strong demand for institutional XRP investment products. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan supported this view, stating last month that there is substantial interest in XRP-based investment vehicles. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 \u2014 TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Skepticism Over Demand Despite the increasing XRP ETF applications, skepticism remains regarding whether these products will attract significant investor interest. Scott Melker, host of The Wolf of All Streets, pointed out that the cryptocurrency market has seen a growing number of ETF filings. He suggested that while he is not opposed to this trend, investors might not immediately purchase these products upon their approval. Melker\u2019s comments reflect broader concerns about demand for crypto ETFs outside Bitcoin. For instance, Ethereum ETFs, launched in July 2024, have experienced relatively low adoption compared to Bitcoin. Since January 2024, Bitcoin ETFs have recorded $35.4 billion in net inflows, while Ethereum ETFs have only seen $2.63 billion since their introduction. Institutional Interest in XRP ETFs In response to Melker\u2019s doubts, Jones reaffirmed her belief that institutions will diversify beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, incorporating XRP ETFs into their investment strategies. She noted that XRP has outperformed Bitcoin by 212% since November 2023 and has gained approximately 250% against Ethereum within the same period. \u201cInstitutions will diversify out of Bitcoin/Eth only and add XRP ETFs to their portfolio,\u201d Jones stated , reinforcing her position that institutional investors will embrace XRP ETF products upon launch. Additionally, proponents argue that asset managers do not typically file for ETFs unless there is market demand. Franklin Templeton\u2019s filing and applications from other asset managers suggest that there is already interest in such products. Leading Firms Pursuing XRP ETFs Besides Franklin Templeton, other notable asset managers who have applied for XRP ETFs include Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Canary Capital. ProShares and Volatility Shares have each submitted filings for three XRP ETFs, while Hashdex and Purpose Investments have proposed non-U.S. versions. Some reports have claimed that VanEck, Fidelity, Galaxy Digital, and Invesco have also filed for XRP ETFs. However, these claims are unverified. With the growing number of XRP ETF filings and increasing discussions surrounding institutional adoption, market analysts continue to assess whether XRP investment products will gain traction similar to Bitcoin ETFs. While skepticism persists, the rising interest from major asset managers suggests that XRP ETFs could soon play a more prominent role in institutional portfolios.

Data shows that investors closed 795 deals in the U.S in AI from January to March, with blockbuster deals like Databricks' $15.3 billion round and Anthropic's $2 billion raise dominating headlines. Crypto's largest blockbuster deal, in comparison, was Abu Dhabi's MGX, with a $2 billion investment into Binance \u2013 the first institutional placement in the crypto exchange. Other deals of note include a $82 million raise from payment infrastructure company Mesh, ETF issuer Bitwise's $70 million round, and digital asset bank Sygnum's $58 million offering. Prior reporting by Pitchbook shows that AI startups attracted one-third of global VC investment in 2024, totaling $131.5 billion, with nearly a quarter of new startups being an AI company across 4,318 VC deals, compared to crypto's $4.9 billion across just 706 deals. Analysis: Has AI stolen crypto's venture dollars? Blockbuster rounds from VCs in the AI space and headline-grabbing antics, such as OpenAI's Sam Altman seeking trillions , and AI's rise from technological novelty to household name thanks to transformer models , would make one think that there's suddenly an investor preference for one over the other. Historically, all data shows that VCs have generally favored AI over crypto, with AI and machine learning attracting consistent funding that's expanded exponentially, according to Statista data , growing from $670 million in 2011 to $36 billion in 2020 and only upwards from there. There's only been one year where crypto beat AI for funding, which was 2021 when VCs poured $30 billion into the market compared to ABI Research 's $22.3 billion AI estimate for the year. Keep in mind that all of this ignores crypto-native quirks like airdrops, which put fresh capital in the hands of users and, in turn, pump the token price, inflating the size of projects' treasuries. A recent report from Dragonfly found that between 2020 and 2024, the 11 largest airdrops generated $7 billion. This won't close the gap between AI and crypto, but it shows that there are more ways to get a dollar than traditional venture capital.", "published_on": "2025-03-14T14:11:02", "url": "https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/14/ai-s-lead-over-crypto-for-vc-dollars-increased-in-q1-25-but-does-this-race-really-matter", "source": "coindesk", "categories": ["BUSINESS", "MARKET", "EXCHANGE", "TRADING", "BNB", "FIAT"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.04772727272727273, "subjectivity": 0.41861471861471866, "sentiment": "neutral"}, "entities": [], "topics": ["billion", "deal", "million", "show"]}, {"id": "41630345", "title": "Solana\u2019s SIMD-228 proposal to reduce SOL inflation by 80% fails to meet approval threshold", "body": "SIMD-228, a proposal seeking to reduce SOL inflation rate by 80%, failed to meet the required vote threshold for approval after many small validators voted against it. According to SIMD Vote Status, 61.39% of voters supported the SIMD-228 governance vote, which was less than the 66.67% required for approval. With a record 74% turnout by the end of voting on Mar. 13, it was the biggest crypto governance vote ever in terms of both market value and participation. The voting pattern revealed a rift among network members despite high engagement. More than 60% of smaller validators with 500,000 Solana ( SOL ) or less voted against the proposal. Validators with greater stakes, on the other hand, overwhelmingly backed it, indicating how the proposal would have impacted various groups. The current inflation system in Solana strikes a balance between burning transaction fees and generating staking rewards. More fees are burned during periods of high network activity, which helps keep inflation under control.

Meanwhile, at an inflation rate of 4.7%, staking rewards keep adding new SOL to the market. The goal of SIMD -228 was to reduce staking rewards, which would slow the growth of SOL\u2019s supply and potentially raise its value. Under the proposal, inflation would have fallen below 1% at the current 65% staking rate. However, smaller validators would have had difficulty remaining profitable, as many of them charge little to no commission. If enough of them left the network, Solana\u2019s decentralization could have weakened, raising concerns about long-term stability. While SIMD-228 failed, a different proposal, SIMD-123, passed with almost 75% support. This modification will enable validators to distribute rewards more transparently by allowing them to split a portion of their earnings with stakeholders via an on-chain system. According to the findings from the just concluded vote, network participants prefer changing validator incentives over lowering inflation.
