(a thread) pic.twitter.com/QlQYU65AZT \u2014 The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) March 13, 2025 This intentional tanking of markets may be driven by several factors, such as a record government deficit reaching $1.15 trillion in February, a desire to lower oil prices, plans to reduce the US trade deficit through tariffs, and a goal to cut government jobs that have accounted for recent job growth. Trump\u2019s economic weakness plans appear to have several goals, including lowering inflation (currently 2.8%), oil prices, and interest rates. He also aims to reduce deficit spending, trade deficits, and government inefficiency. Economist Joe Foudy told Newsweek that this is a \u201cpolitical recognition\u201d before adding: \u201cIf the stock market responds negatively or if we see weaker economic data, Trump needs to get ahead of the narrative. By framing short-term economic downturns as necessary for long-term gains, he is managing expectations.\u201d \u201cNormally, the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates to stabilize the economy. But if tariffs drive up prices, policymakers may hesitate, fearing rate cuts could fuel inflation,\u201d commented NYU economics professor Lawrence White. Trump is clearly telling his plans. He doesn\u2019t care about the stock market or the crypto market. All he cares about is that interest rates to go down which will definitely cause some short-term pain.

As traditional markets experience downturns, investors may reduce exposure to high-risk assets like crypto to cover losses elsewhere or move to cash positions, more so if interest rates increase again. Market instability could also lead to liquidity issues in crypto markets, potentially causing exaggerated price movements. Crypto might continue following stock market trends in the short term.\u00a0The market has already declined by around 25% over the past couple of months as $1 trillion has left the space. In the long term, lowering interest rates could eventually benefit it as an alternative investment when cheap money looks for yields. Moreover, economic instability might accelerate crypto regulation efforts, which could provide clarity and potentially attract more institutional adoption. If the strategy affects dollar strength, which has weakened recently , cryptocurrencies could benefit as alternatives to fiat currencies. Over time, crypto markets could gradually decouple from traditional markets as the sector matures and establishes its own economic cycles, however there is likely to be more pain before any gains.

EXCLUSIVELY on the pump fun app download NOW \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/8YKK8DpGrM \u2014 pump.fun (@pumpdotfun) March 13, 2025 The rise and fall of Pump.fun\u2019s livestream feature Pump.fun launched its livestream feature to help creators court awareness and engagement around their memecoins. Creators could launch meme tokens and then use livestreaming events to get more users to buy the tokens and drive the prices up in real-time. This concept isn\u2019t exactly novel as e-commerce platforms in countries like China employ similar sales strategies to better demo their products. However, the reality was different from the vision thanks to a lack of content moderation, which is not exactly a staple of the crypto industry. The livestream feature became an arena for harmful content, with users streaming racist, pornographic, and other abusive materials, such as animal abuse and threats to commit bodily harm to themselves and their family members, all in a bid to get more users to buy their memecoins. The series of events caused widespread backlash and forced one of Pump.fun\u2019s founders, Alon Cohen, to announce that it will shut down the livestream feature while they find modern ways to tackle video content moderation. Messaging to the rescue? Following the unfortunate end of the livestream feature, it seems Pump.fun has shifted its focus to DMs and group messaging as one of the tools for community engagement on the platform. It\u2019s also a welcome development as it gives the platform more control over content moderation. However, it doesn\u2019t totally insulate the feature from being abused again. There\u2019s the existential tendency of people trying to do extreme things to court attention for their memecoin launches. It\u2019s just too early to determine how the messaging features will be used. According to speculators, this may also be a chance for Pump.fun to redeem itself from the livestreaming debacle and also get more activity on the platform which has recorded a decline in activity compared to it\u2019s meteoric rise last year. Upon the announcement of the indefinite closure of its livestreaming feature, activities on Pump.fun reportedly dropped by 50% late last year. It saw a temporary uptick earlier in January, but it has been down badly after memecoins such as LIBRA and TRUMP caused tremendous losses to holders despite being heavily supported by leading political figures like Javier Milei and Donald Trump, respectively. Pump.fun has had an eventful year in the memecoin space Despite recent setbacks, Pump.fun remains a dominant player in the memecoin market. Pump.fun launched with lots of promise in January of 2024, and it was responsible for over 70% of the memecoins launched on the Solana blockchain at some point last year. For its creators, Pump.fun has been a lucrative venture as they get to charge a 1% trading fee as well as SOL charges for memecoins that satisfy its criteria to move into larger exchanges. The memecoin launchpad also rakes in large amounts in trading fees, reaching as high as $15 million at its peak. However, Pump.fun\u2019s journey hasn\u2019t exactly been smooth this year as it currently faces a series of class action lawsuits in the United States. In December 2024, the United Kingdom\u2019s financial authority, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), warned the public that Pump.fun isn\u2019t authorized to operate in the country, leading to Pump.fun restricting access to its platform to users in the UK. The restriction means UK users still cannot access the memecoin launchpad and its new messaging feature. Adding to Pump.fun\u2019s troubles, its official X account was recently hacked, with attackers promoting fraudulent tokens. As expected, the new messaging feature was received with mixed feelings by Pump.fun\u2019s community. Some users are skeptical, while others are more receptive. One user on X (@0xKaco) said, \u201cPump fun has always been a social platform 1st and a trading platform 2nd,\u201d with another user highlighting concerns from the livestream mishap and asking if no one will be harassed or sent slurs for selling. Despite all the speculations, some users are already testing the new feature and announcing their new group chats on X. The coming months will be a determinant for many users and speculators of the platform if the new feature is a better upgrade or carry on with the legacy of the livestreaming feature.

However, it has temporarily stopped bearish due to a bounce and regained strength with notable gains in the past 24 hours. Since last week, KAS has seen a major move as trading levels change to the downside. This came with a monthly breakdown, and the price fell to a new multi-month low of $0.0557. It recovered briefly from the low to retest the recently broken support as resistance and now faces rejection. As a result, the price is weak, following a 2% loss. A further loss could bring selling pressure back into the market. This could later lead to another breakdown capable of plunging the price into the $0.04 range. If the price recovers higher, it may revisit the $0.09 level before losing grip. As of now, there are no signs of strong commitment from the bulls\u2019 side, as the demand level appears low. The only condition for a trend shift lies in a significant increase above the previous monthly low. But from the looks of things, KAS has shown no signs of slowing down yet.

A breakout of this pattern could trigger a major trend shift. The sharp bounce off the $2.35 level brought a substantial recovery in TIA\u2019s price during last month\u2019s trading, but it was short-lived under $4.5, and the price fell. This triggered a violent drop earlier this month, and the price rolled back amid rising supply throughout last week. This time, the $2.6 level produced support and the crypto-asset increased suddenly to $3.8 yesterday. It faced rejection and dropped to around $3.5 at the time of writing. The price remains strong, but things may go south if it continues to face rejection. A weekly close above the rejected monthly high should validate a slight shift in the trend before rallying hard to the top. Failure to close above this high could result in another drop with a potential breakdown. Another bullish indicator to pay attention to is the double-bottom pattern on the daily chart.

Following a notable surge from its recent low, it appeared strong daily while undergoing a retracement. Looking back, Pepe has shed a lot of loss in the past weeks as the price broke through several support levels to reach a year low of $0.0000052 on Tuesday. This came following a recent dump from $0.0000089. Luckily for the bulls, the low level held as support after an interception and the price bounced back. Reiterating actions yesterday, they managed to close the price an inch above $0.000007 with an engulfing bullish bar. This indicates strong volume inflow in the last 48 hours, and as we can see, the price looks strong on the day despite seeing a slight rejection. If the market further shows strength, Pepe may retest the monthly high, where it initiated a dump earlier this month. Scaling through this high could activate a retracement towards $0.000014 before rolling back. A continuous rejection under this high could result in another leg down, capable of dipping the price to a new yearly low. While it remains under the bears\u2019 radar, it currently leads the daily altcoins gains following a steady recovery since Tuesday. Pepe\u2019s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Pushing higher, the immediate hurdles for the bulls lie at $0.000089 \u2013 marked at the monthly high. A successful surge above it should send the price to $0.0000114 and $0.0000147 in a retracement phase. If the meme coin loses grip, there\u2019s minor support at $0.0000065, while $0.00000526 stands as support.

The bears appear set to mount pressure again as supply slowly increases. It looks weak following a 3% loss in the past hours. DOT\u2019s daily outlook remains weak following a roller-coaster reduction in the last three months. Bears have fully taken control in the short term. The early month dump has not just caused panic and fear for the mid-term investors but has put DOT in a more bearish condition over the past few days, and from the look of things, it is not showing signs of slowing down yet. It just resumed selling after taking a day break. The weekly $3.65 low may pose a little threat as the bears slowly mount pressure. A pull-off this low could dip the price to a new multi-year low. Such a dip will bring an end to the bull season and, at the same time, trigger a long-term bearish sentiment. Another pointer to watch for this bearish signal is the steady decline in the daily volume indicator. We may see a short retracement if the bulls defend the weekly low well.

The cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing a slump, with Bitcoin and Ethereum trading below $82k and $2k respectively. One of the major catalysts, according to Lunardi, is the anticipated regulatory clarity from the Trump Administration. On the Milk Road podcast, he said that the administration\u2019s forthcoming policies on compliant tokens will likely unlock substantial investment, particularly from institutional investors. \u201cWe\u2019re about to see clear regulatory guidelines on what it means to have a compliant token, which will reduce risks and encourage more institutional capital to flow into the market,\u201d Lunardi said. Lunardi also pointed to the fading prominence of meme coins as a bullish indicator. While many have seen the decline of meme coins as a sign of a bear market, Lunardi views it as a positive shift, suggesting that liquidity from meme coins will likely be reallocated into more established altcoins, potentially benefiting diverse crypto portfolios. Furthermore, Lunardi said that institutional capital inflows and the rise of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will provide significant support to the market, helping to stabilize prices and facilitate broader crypto adoption. \u201cThe infrastructure for institutional capital is in place, with more ETFs opening up the market,\u201d he explained.

The video, titled \u201cTHIS WILL GUARANTEE A $1000 XRP PRICE,\u201d focuses on ten key factors that, according to CryptoSensei, could significantly boost XRP\u2019s adoption and market valuation in the coming years. #1 Regulatory Clarity For XRP CryptoSensei begins by underscoring the ongoing legal situation involving the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs, mentioning the partial appeal of the court\u2019s July 2023 ruling. While stressing that the appeal does not designate XRP itself as a security, he notes that \u201cwe still have the case against Brad and Chris [referring to Ripple executives] going.\u201d The resolution of these legal hurdles, he argues, is crucial for broader institutional adoption within the United States. \u201cIf we want the type of movement we\u2019re looking for inside the US, we need those things to come to an end,\u201d CryptoSensei says, alluding to the potential for major banks like Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and BNY Mellon to officially engage with XRP once regulatory clarity is achieved. #2 Institutions Standing By To Use XRP The video highlights a series of statements from major financial institutions, including the CEO of BNY Mellon, who indicated that crypto custody and tokenized assets are among the bank\u2019s future priorities. According to CryptoSensei, banks are \u201cready to jump in,\u201d but are hesitant to make large-scale commitments without clear regulatory guidelines. He emphasizes that if XRP were to host \u201ceven 5 or 10%\u201d of a multi-trillion-dollar global tokenization market, the price could reach four- or five-digit figures. #3 Potential SEC Case Drops A noteworthy discussion point is the SEC\u2019s recent trend of dropping cases (or opting not to pursue them) against certain crypto firms. CryptoSensei mentions that the Commission \u201cdropped the case against OpenSea, Coinbase, [and] Robinhood,\u201d suggesting a possible shift in enforcement strategy. \u201cIs Ripple, in fact, next? \u2026 If the [former] Trump administration wants to stand by their word of working with the crypto industry and not against them, I do believe this is coming,\u201d he posits. #4 Tokenization Of Real-World Assets (RWAs) Central to CryptoSensei\u2019s thesis is the growing trend of tokenizing traditional assets\u2014ranging from real estate to debt instruments\u2014on blockchain networks. He cites Ripple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz, who says the XRP Ledger (XRPL) could be \u201ca really good platform\u201d for these tokenization projects, thanks to its low fees, integrated decentralized exchange (DEX), and multi-asset support. Schwartz explained: \u201cIf someone\u2019s going to buy or sell tokenized real-world assets, they want to be able to do that with whatever asset is convenient for them.\u201d CryptoSensei further highlights how Robinhood\u2019s documentation from January 2025 (mentioned in the video) cites Ripple\u2019s success in tokenizing hundreds of millions of dollars in real-world assets on the XRPL\u2014projects that aim to expand into the billions and eventually trillions. #5 Interoperability Bridges Another critical piece is interoperability. CryptoSensei references the Axelar network, which is bridging the XRPL mainnet, the XRP Ledger EVM sidechain, and over 55 other blockchains. The expansion of cross-chain liquidity is described as \u201cliquidity, liquidity, liquidity.\u201d He points out that the XRPL\u2019s design\u2014integrating DEX functionality directly into the protocol\u2014simplifies asset swaps and liquidity provisioning, boosting its appeal for large-scale tokenization. #6 Cross-Border Payment Solutions Ripple\u2019s long-standing focus on remittances and cross-border payments also features prominently. CryptoSensei shows a clip describing how a US-to-Mexico corridor, facilitated by XRP, can settle in mere minutes at a fraction of legacy fees. \u201cAll of that takes about 10 minutes, which used to be three days,\u201d says a Ripple spokesperson in the included clip, also noting that these transactions can be up to \u201c20-odd basis points cheaper.\u201d He argues that such improvements in speed and cost will eventually outcompete outdated correspondent banking rails, potentially capturing a significant portion of the multi-billion-dollar global remittance market. #7 Collaborations With Key Global Institutions In the video, CryptoSensei showcases the Bank for International Settlements\u2019 (BIS) Cross-Border Payments Interoperability and Extension Task Force, listing Ripple alongside only a handful of major international payment networks\u2014such as Mastercard, SWIFT, and EBA Clearing. He emphasizes Ripple\u2019s unique position as the only blockchain infrastructure provider on the roster, describing it as a testament to the company\u2019s significance in shaping next-generation payment standards. #8 Treasury Market On XRP Ledger Referencing Ondo\u2019s tokenization initiatives, CryptoSensei highlights the possibility of US Treasuries migrating onto blockchains, potentially including the XRP Ledger. He notes the US Treasury market alone stands at over $28 trillion, while globally, the bond market encompasses roughly $130 trillion. \u201cCould you imagine five or ten trillion dollars finding its way onto the XRP Ledger over the next five to ten years?\u201d he asks, suggesting even a fraction of that capital would profoundly affect XRP\u2019s valuation. #9 Derivatives Expansion According to the video, derivatives\u2014often said to represent notional values in the hundreds of trillions to over a quadrillion dollars\u2014are a prime target for on-chain tokenization. CryptoSensei points to Bitstamp, which is building a derivatives exchange on the XRPL. He believes that capturing a slice of these massive markets could drive significant demand for XRP, especially if large holders lock up tokens for long-term liquidity provisioning. #10 Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) Finally, the pundit underscores Ripple\u2019s work with various central banks on CBDC pilots. He cites projects under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and notes that Ripple was recently named the top technology provider for CBDCs by Juniper Research. From the Bank of International Settlements to major economies in Asia, CryptoSensei posits that the institutional relationships Ripple has forged place XRP in a strategic position to bridge disparate currencies and networks. \u201cRipple is working with up to 30 central banks,\u201d he states, emphasizing that these ongoing partnerships may open doors for XRP to serve as a liquidity tool in sovereign-level digital currencies. While some of the claims\u2014such as XRP reaching \u201cfour or five digits\u201d\u2014are extremely bullish and hinge on multiple converging factors, CryptoSensei remains steadfast: if even a few of these catalysts unfold in Ripple\u2019s favor, he envisions a drastically higher valuation for XRP. Throughout the video, he stresses that regulatory clarity in the United States is the linchpin to unlocking widespread adoption. \u201cIf all of these things happen,\u201d he concludes, \u201cyou better believe we\u2019re looking at a four to five digit price.\u201d At press time, XRP traded at $2.31.

As one of the top altcoins, price action often moves the entire crypto market. This is happening when memecoins like Pepe (PEPE) and DuragDoge ($DURAG) are still hot. If XRP breaks out it will bring in more liquidity and speculation across the altcoin space. Memecoins, known for their volatility and hype driven rallies, will see huge gains as traders rotate into them. Let\u2019s get into what\u2019s driving the impending XRP breakout and its impact on PEPE and DuragDoge. Ripple (XRP): On the Verge of Massive Breakout Amid SEC Challenges XRP moved recently after what seemed like an eternity of sideways grinding. Even experienced traders might become confused when an asset moves in such a manner. The problem is that experienced chart observers look at more than price movement. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), which they are tracking, currently provides an intriguing narrative. According to a new perspective from Matrixport, a well-known brand in digital asset management, an RSI hovering around 40% is frequently an indication that a rally may be about to begin. And you know what? The value of XRP is hovering around that threshold. However, Matrixport\u2019s analysts believe that the SEC v. Ripple legal dispute will continue to dominate XRP\u2019s future. The financial watchdog recently deleted the civil lawsuits it had filed against the cryptocurrency startup from its database. The long-running lawsuit may be coming to a close, or at the very least, it may be revisited, according to several members of the XRP community. Pepe (PEPE): Good Time to Invest or Hold Off? Pepe Coin has acquired significant traction in the memecoin market as one of the top altcoins. Unlike other memecoins, Pepe coin started as an entertaining online culture driven project. The coin is highly influenced by meme culture, which, as we all know, is the reason why so many cryptocurrencies are popular today. When the price of Pepe rose significantly, serious investors and crypto enthusiasts paid attention to it; wondering how far this meme could stretch. The upcoming breakout of XRP stands a chance of positively affecting memecoins such as Pepe. It is clear from Pepecoin\u2019s price nowadays that the coin has done well, but the question is, will its price continue to rise? Market trends, active members within the community, and memes that serve as advertisement influence the price of Pepe Coin significantly. Because of the coin\u2019s vast and loyal following, analysts believe Pepe\u2019s price might have a good few months ahead of it. DuragDoge ($DURAG): The Ultimate Memecoin with Style and Swagger People understand that anytime a cryptocurrency with a large market size, for instance XRP, experiences a breakout, this means new liquidity is available in the market. Seeing profits from XRP, investors can reinvest into high-potential altcoins, including memecoins like $DURAG. This new money can increase trading volume and therefore set price appreciation for the token. DuragDoge is not a copycat, it\u2019s the rush of street life and the fun of memecoin. The project promises to rewrite the script and bring something new and real even as it acknowledges the meme currency market is full of copycats and overhyped promises. The objective is to create a community driven by the drip, driven by aspiration, and powered by cryptocurrency. Known as a swagger coin, DuragDoge is designed for the street to reward people who \u201cwork hard, show off, and don\u2019t hesitate to take risks.\u201d With $DURAG as its badge of honour, the initiative keeps true to this narrative by building a bold, inventive community that always shows off the hustle. For those who believe in their glow up, Durag Doge is a lifestyle, a silky durag and powered by the hood\u2019s energy, street smarts and swag. Analysts say it\u2019s one of the high-potential altcoins set for growth sooner than expected. Conclusion XRP is about to make a big move and its breakout will trigger a dominos effect in the altcoin market. Memecoins like PEPE and $DURAG will benefit if liquidity and speculation increases. PEPE and $DURAG will ride this wave and moon as traders look for the next big moonshot. Follow Durag Doge on X and Telegram for the latest news and updates.

The notable bleeding of major stock indexes has trickled down into the crypto market, as Bitcoin price slipped from trading above $101k to around $82k on Thursday, March 13, during the early New York trading session. The altcoin market has recorded the highest losses in the past few months, led by Ethereum (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE). As a result, the question lingering in most crypto traders is when and if an altseason will happen in 2025. Altseason 2025 Key Insights From historical data, the altcoin season has been kickstarted by the reversal of the macro Bitcoin dominance. However, the introduction of spot crypto ETFs has significantly disrupted the historical crypto cash rotation, thus complicating the expected timeline of the altseason 2025. From a technical analysis perspective, the Others/BTC pair in the weekly timeframe is currently retesting a crucial support level, which in the past cycles yielded parabolic altseason. However, the altseason will be delayed if the altcoin market fails to rebound from the current levels in the coming weeks. #Altseason is Ready To Go $Total 2 is showing the same ready-to-go pattern for Altseason.

However, the administration change in the United States under President Donald Trump, which has significantly focused on providing clear crypto regulations, has favored a rejuvenated mainstream adoption of digital assets , led by DeFi tokens. The launch of the Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin has heavily democratized the adoption of crypto assets by retail and institutional investors. Considering all the factors, top altcoins to keep a close watch on in the anticipated altseason include the heavily oversold tokens, especially those with robust leadership and a supportive online community. For instance, Shiba Inu (SHIB), Notcoin (NOT), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), PancakeSwap (CAKE), and Uniswap (UNI). .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Chief Judge John Dorsey rejected FTX\u2019s debtors\u2019 argument that the amended proof of claim (POC) from 3AC liquidators was untimely and an unjust attempt to slow the bankruptcy proceedings. In a March 13 ruling in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, Dorsey opined that 3AC liquidators had provided sufficient notice of their claim and the possibility of amending it once they had analyzed all the available information. Any delay, he said, was caused by FTX\u2019s failure to share relevant records promptly.

They later expanded it in November 2024 , alleging claims including breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and breach of fiduciary duty. The liquidators alleged FTX held $1.53 billion in the hedge fund assets that were liquidated to settle $1.33 billion in liabilities in 2022. They argued that the transactions were avoidable, caused harm to 3AC creditors and that FTX debtors had delayed providing the information that would have uncovered the liquidation. FTX debtors objected to the amended claim, saying that the original POC was insufficient to inform them about the nature and amount 3AC liquidators would be claiming and that it came too late and should be disallowed. Related: FTX filed for bankruptcy 2 years ago \u2014 What\u2019s happening now? Before its collapse in June 2022 , Three Arrows Capital was once one of the industry\u2019s largest crypto hedge funds, with over $3 billion in assets. Its liquidators also pursued claims against collapsed crypto firm Terraform Labs through a $1.3 billion claim in Terra\u2019s bankruptcy case. At the same time, FTX, which filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, has been undertaking its own recovery efforts to reclaim funds. In November last year, it filed a trio of lawsuits, one against SkyBridge Capital and its founder, Anthony Scaramucci, to recoup funds spent by former FTX CEO Sam \u201cSBF\u201d Bankman-Fried on sponsorship and investment deals. Another suit was filed against crypto exchange Binance and its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao , to recover $1.76 billion worth of cryptocurrency sent to the exchange as part of a July 2021 repurchase deal.

Here\u2019s why", "body": "A financial expert has argued that institutions would expand their crypto investment strategies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum by adding XRP ETFs to their portfolios. This perspective follows Franklin Templeton\u2019s recent filing for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) , bringing the total number of proposed XRP ETFs to 15. Linda P. Jones, author of the finance book, \u201c3 Steps to Quantum Wealth\u201d emphasized this shift, suggesting that institutional investors will look beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum as market dynamics evolve. She contends that recent market trends, including XRP\u2019s strong performance relative to Bitcoin and Ethereum, indicate growing interest in the asset. A Record Number of XRP ETF Filings Franklin Templeton\u2019s move to file for an XRP ETF has set a new benchmark, with XRP now leading all other cryptocurrencies in ETF filings. The total of 15 proposed XRP ETFs surpasses the number of filings for Bitcoin, which stands at 11, and Ethereum, which has seen only 8 filings. Some see the surge in ETF applications as an indication of strong demand for institutional XRP investment products. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan supported this view, stating last month that there is substantial interest in XRP-based investment vehicles. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 \u2014 TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Skepticism Over Demand Despite the increasing XRP ETF applications, skepticism remains regarding whether these products will attract significant investor interest. Scott Melker, host of The Wolf of All Streets, pointed out that the cryptocurrency market has seen a growing number of ETF filings. He suggested that while he is not opposed to this trend, investors might not immediately purchase these products upon their approval. Melker\u2019s comments reflect broader concerns about demand for crypto ETFs outside Bitcoin. For instance, Ethereum ETFs, launched in July 2024, have experienced relatively low adoption compared to Bitcoin. Since January 2024, Bitcoin ETFs have recorded $35.4 billion in net inflows, while Ethereum ETFs have only seen $2.63 billion since their introduction. Institutional Interest in XRP ETFs In response to Melker\u2019s doubts, Jones reaffirmed her belief that institutions will diversify beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, incorporating XRP ETFs into their investment strategies. She noted that XRP has outperformed Bitcoin by 212% since November 2023 and has gained approximately 250% against Ethereum within the same period. \u201cInstitutions will diversify out of Bitcoin/Eth only and add XRP ETFs to their portfolio,\u201d Jones stated , reinforcing her position that institutional investors will embrace XRP ETF products upon launch. Additionally, proponents argue that asset managers do not typically file for ETFs unless there is market demand. Franklin Templeton\u2019s filing and applications from other asset managers suggest that there is already interest in such products. Leading Firms Pursuing XRP ETFs Besides Franklin Templeton, other notable asset managers who have applied for XRP ETFs include Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Canary Capital. ProShares and Volatility Shares have each submitted filings for three XRP ETFs, while Hashdex and Purpose Investments have proposed non-U.S. versions. Some reports have claimed that VanEck, Fidelity, Galaxy Digital, and Invesco have also filed for XRP ETFs. However, these claims are unverified. With the growing number of XRP ETF filings and increasing discussions surrounding institutional adoption, market analysts continue to assess whether XRP investment products will gain traction similar to Bitcoin ETFs. While skepticism persists, the rising interest from major asset managers suggests that XRP ETFs could soon play a more prominent role in institutional portfolios.

Data shows that investors closed 795 deals in the U.S in AI from January to March, with blockbuster deals like Databricks' $15.3 billion round and Anthropic's $2 billion raise dominating headlines. Crypto's largest blockbuster deal, in comparison, was Abu Dhabi's MGX, with a $2 billion investment into Binance \u2013 the first institutional placement in the crypto exchange. Other deals of note include a $82 million raise from payment infrastructure company Mesh, ETF issuer Bitwise's $70 million round, and digital asset bank Sygnum's $58 million offering. Prior reporting by Pitchbook shows that AI startups attracted one-third of global VC investment in 2024, totaling $131.5 billion, with nearly a quarter of new startups being an AI company across 4,318 VC deals, compared to crypto's $4.9 billion across just 706 deals. Analysis: Has AI stolen crypto's venture dollars? Blockbuster rounds from VCs in the AI space and headline-grabbing antics, such as OpenAI's Sam Altman seeking trillions , and AI's rise from technological novelty to household name thanks to transformer models , would make one think that there's suddenly an investor preference for one over the other. Historically, all data shows that VCs have generally favored AI over crypto, with AI and machine learning attracting consistent funding that's expanded exponentially, according to Statista data , growing from $670 million in 2011 to $36 billion in 2020 and only upwards from there. There's only been one year where crypto beat AI for funding, which was 2021 when VCs poured $30 billion into the market compared to ABI Research 's $22.3 billion AI estimate for the year. Keep in mind that all of this ignores crypto-native quirks like airdrops, which put fresh capital in the hands of users and, in turn, pump the token price, inflating the size of projects' treasuries. A recent report from Dragonfly found that between 2020 and 2024, the 11 largest airdrops generated $7 billion.

According to SIMD Vote Status, 61.39% of voters supported the SIMD-228 governance vote, which was less than the 66.67% required for approval. With a record 74% turnout by the end of voting on Mar. 13, it was the biggest crypto governance vote ever in terms of both market value and participation. The voting pattern revealed a rift among network members despite high engagement. More than 60% of smaller validators with 500,000 Solana ( SOL ) or less voted against the proposal. Validators with greater stakes, on the other hand, overwhelmingly backed it, indicating how the proposal would have impacted various groups. The current inflation system in Solana strikes a balance between burning transaction fees and generating staking rewards. More fees are burned during periods of high network activity, which helps keep inflation under control. You might also like: Solana still leads in DEX trading volumes despite meme coin frenzy cool-off However, fewer tokens are being removed from circulation as transaction costs have declined. Meanwhile, at an inflation rate of 4.7%, staking rewards keep adding new SOL to the market. The goal of SIMD -228 was to reduce staking rewards, which would slow the growth of SOL\u2019s supply and potentially raise its value. Under the proposal, inflation would have fallen below 1% at the current 65% staking rate. However, smaller validators would have had difficulty remaining profitable, as many of them charge little to no commission. If enough of them left the network, Solana\u2019s decentralization could have weakened, raising concerns about long-term stability. While SIMD-228 failed, a different proposal, SIMD-123, passed with almost 75% support. This modification will enable validators to distribute rewards more transparently by allowing them to split a portion of their earnings with stakeholders via an on-chain system. According to the findings from the just concluded vote, network participants prefer changing validator incentives over lowering inflation.

The 25% steel and aluminum tariffs implemented by President Trump\u2014along with selective exemptions for countries like Canada\u2014have magnified concerns about economic turmoil. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick\u2019s defense of these policies did little to ease apprehension, sending U.S. stocks further downward and dragging crypto with them. Amid Bitcoin\u2019s struggle to recapture its former vigor, even hints at a possible Trump-backed crypto reserve failed to spark sustained gains. Consequently, many traders are shifting their focus to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which has reached Phase 3 of its presale at $0.02 and is attracting considerable interest. Volatility has shaken the broader crypto market: Ether has dropped to a three-year low near $1,873.87, while XRP, Cardano, and Solana are hovering around their worst levels this year. Dogecoin\u2019s 2.3% uptick was not enough to counteract the market\u2019s overall slide. Against this backdrop, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as a safe haven, raising $3.3 million from 5,600 participants. With Phase 3 quickly selling out and the token price set to climb to $0.025, investors appear motivated to buy in before prices rise. Strengthening Community Engagement Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capitalizing on a flight to quality. Unlike purely speculative coins, its structured lending protocol and built-in buy-pressure features contribute to greater stability. Investors can still acquire tokens at $0.02 during Phase 3, after which a 25% price increase will occur. A post-launch listing at $0.06 ensures at least a 2x return for latecomers, but some analysts predict the token could surge to around $2.50\u2014an impressive 12,400% gain from current levels. In contrast to hype-fueled meme tokens or inflation-sensitive Bitcoin, Mutuum\u2019s value stems from concrete DeFi participation. Through mtToken technology, user deposits in ETH or DAI earn interest-bearing tokens, driving ongoing demand. Part of the protocol\u2019s revenue supports automatic buybacks of MUTM, which are then distributed to stakers, thus limiting supply and sustaining demand. This setup has led to brisk Phase 3 sales, drawing both institutional and retail investors eager to stake their claims early. Navigating Market Swings with Purpose As Bitcoin contends with macroeconomic headwinds, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) seeks to maintain stability through use-case-driven adoption. Overcollateralized loans and peer-to-peer lending cater to those needing liquidity without liquidating core holdings. Meanwhile, a $100,000 presale giveaway further incentivizes early involvement. With the release of U.S. CPI data looming, Mutuum\u2019s growing presale is seen as a hedge against market unpredictability. Time is short for those hoping to buy MUTM at $0.02 as Phase 3 nears its capacity. History shows that worthwhile presale tokens rarely remain at bargain-basement prices\u2014especially once they list publicly and potentially leap in value. For investors worried about Bitcoin\u2019s stagnation amid tariff anxieties, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a more measured opportunity for yield-based gains. With over 5,600 investors already on board, the momentum is palpable\u2014underscoring the market\u2019s preference for utility over speculation. Act Before Phase 4 Kicks Off Delaying could mean missing out on both the 25% presale spike and even greater post-launch appreciation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) avoids empty hype by backing its tokens with tangible demand\u2014an approach that could define the DeFi landscape in 2025. As Bitcoin wavers and altcoins languish, MUTM may represent the market\u2019s next big development. Seize the chance before Phase 3 closes.

The poll revealed that 57% of the respondents thought that the economic policies have created an unsteady situation as some decisions have triggered global trade wars. 51% believed that the economy would worsen a year from now, 7 points higher than in January before the president took office. 55% of the poll\u2019s respondents also believed that Trump\u2019s cuts to federal programs would do more economic harm than good. The respondents also suggested that the president should try to combat the current high consumer prices. A majority of the respondents also worried that the policies would drive prices up instead of bringing them down. Trump enacted the import tariffs last week, imposing 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports and a 10% tariff on Chinese imports. Other policies include tax cuts, reductions in government spending, cuts to federal programs, mass layoffs of federal workers, and deregulation. The president\u2019s policies have sparked uncertainty on Wall Street and in the crypto markets, leading to plunges in stocks and most digital assets. The markets also experienced major sell-offs on Monday amid the increasing fear. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.08% on Monday and is down 1.25% today. The S&P 500 dropped 2.7% on Monday and is down 1.37% today. Bitcoin dropped below $77,000 this week before recovering to above $80,000. The coin is still down over 2% today, trading at $80,280 at the time of writing.

Economist @JustinWolfers calls Trump's economic policy \u201cchaotic\u201d & says it could spark a recession: pic.twitter.com/dlYWag1g13 \u2014 Rosemary Church (@rosemaryCNN) March 13, 2025 Trump\u2019s policies have raised speculations about the possibility of a recession beginning this year. Several indicators, like the higher unemployment rate in February, show the slowdown in the economy after Trump\u2019s presidency. The February Consumer Price Index (CPI) report also revealed a 2.8% rise in inflation year-on-year. The inflation still cooled down compared to January\u2019s 3.0% rise on an annual basis. A recession involves a sharp and significant decline in economic activity that lasts more than a few months. Groundwork Collective\u2019s policy and advocacy chief, Alex Jacquez, reportedly mentioned that the economy\u2019s driver depended on businesses investing and hiring and people spending. Jacquez further suggested that spending could be reduced if citizens feared for their jobs or more layoffs in the future. The CNN poll notably highlighted that respondents were cutting back on part of their spending to sustain their budget. 71% of the respondents changed the kind of groceries they used to buy in order to stay within their budget. To afford necessities, 67% of the respondents had to cut on extra spending like entertainment and extras. JPMorgan Chase has predicted a 40% chance of recession if Trump continues with his \u2018extreme\u2019 economic policies. Goldman Sachs also raised the probability of recession from 15% to 20% due to the slow house market, Trump\u2019s tariffs, and government spending cuts. Economist Justin Wolfers further mentioned that the \u2018chaotic\u2019 Trump policies could trigger a recession. The prediction market Polymarket\u2019s poll on \u2018U.S. Recession in 2025?\u2019 currently has a 39% vote. Consumer confidence drops significantly in February Consumer confidence plunged drastically in February, dropping to the lowest level in three and a half years, dropping from 105.3 in January to 98.3 in February. As Americans indicated anxiety about economic conditions worsening, 12-month inflation worries also rose among consumers. Consumer Confidence in February Source: Reuters FWDBONDS chief economist Christopher Rupkey commented on the dropping consumer confidence, mentioning that Americans were being more pessimistic about the future outlook. Rupkey explained that Trump\u2019s administration was the first administration to threaten mass layoffs of federal employees. The economist also mentioned that the policies could cause a halt in the economy as soon as the first quarter of this year. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Despite inherent volatility, many view these price swings as temporary, expecting a strong bull market when rates fall and liquidity increases. I\u2019ve been bullish on altcoins for years and remain committed to this long-term macro thesis, accepting the market\u2019s ups and downs.
