Now, the entire market\u2019s price is dictated by what the US Fed Chair says at his next FOMC meeting. Literally letting a centralised entity dictate the entire fate of supposedly \u2018decentralised\u2019 assets. \n\nBefore you tell me I don\u2019t understand economics or that we need ideal macro conditions to trigger a rally, please stop. None of the previous cycles required perfect conditions to flourish. In 2021, we experienced a COVID recession with an economy in shambles. In 2017, the US entered quantitative tightening in September, right before a major altcoin rally. \n\nWe weren\u2019t checking every day for the next CPI report or unemployment data release. Do you know why? Because people believed crypto was worth HOLDING, not for short-term gains to dump it later, but because it could play a significant role in the future of finance and that it may hold great value in the future.\n\nThe narrative I see now is the exact opposite: almost no one believes in the technology or its potential for adoption. Everyone is just bagholding to make a quick profit and then dumping. What\u2019s even more amusing is that stock traders aren\u2019t as obsessed with these numbers as I\u2019ve seen crypto enthusiasts be lately \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: we have historically never had a better opportunity for full-scale adoption than right now. That\u2019s why I keep buying and ignore the noise. Crypto isn\u2019t going anywhere; it\u2019s only going to grow. The US now even holds a reserve for it, if you had told me years ago that ETH and altcoin prices would drop this low, I would\u2019ve called you crazy.\n\nAnd that\u2019s all the confirmation I need: the only reason we haven\u2019t seen an alt season or ETH soaring isn\u2019t due to a lack of fundamentals, but because people are being impatient and fearful.\n\nTo me, there\u2019s essentially no rational reason why we shouldn\u2019t see a parabolic run. This cycle is no different from the others; if anything, it\u2019s in a much stronger position than previous cycles. All you need to do is trust the process.\n\nI made the mistake of selling my bags too early in 2017, thinking it was just a fad, and then getting in too late in 2021. But that\u2019s part of the learning process. You see the same patterns over the years, people calling it a scam, insisting it\u2019s going to die, and then watching it come back stronger every time. Eventually, you really start to appreciate its cyclical nature and ignore all the noise. \n\nRant over.", "created_utc": "2025-03-14T08:31:39", "score": 39, "num_comments": 103, "author": "To_k", "permalink": "/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jarbxg/yall_are_turning_crypto_into_tradfi/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jarbxg/yall_are_turning_crypto_into_tradfi/", "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.10630952380952377, "subjectivity": 0.5073280423280424, "sentiment": "positive"}, "entities": ["ethereum"], "topics": ["need", "cycle", "people"]}, {"id": "1jabqax", "title": "US Head Of State to acquire a stake in Binance", "body": "", "created_utc": "2025-03-13T21:17:27", "score": 237, "num_comments": 37, "author": "Dongerated", "permalink": "/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jabqax/us_head_of_state_to_acquire_a_stake_in_binance/", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/trump-family-has-held-deal-talks-with-binance-following-crypto-exchanges-guilty-plea-05b029fa", "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.0, "subjectivity": 0.0, "sentiment": "neutral"}, "entities": [], "topics": ["head", "state", "acquire", "stake"]}, {"id": "1jabgyc", "title": "Sen.

I\u2019ve been in crypto since last bull run and have been aware of auto buys but it just never really occurred to me to do it myself. I guess I just thought I wouldn\u2019t auto buy enough for it to make a difference. But I figure now that something is better than nothing. I plan to continue to let it buy for the foreseeable future (next couple years). Only thing that bothers me is that CB charges a dollar every purchase so my $8 turns into $7 and I pay Coinbase $365 per year to do this. CB advertises Coinbase One and says I can avoid fees by signing up, however, it\u2019s $30/month which is the same as I\u2019m paying anyway without the subscription. I guess I\u2019m just trying to find a better way to purchase daily. I like using CB because it takes it directly from my bank and I don\u2019t have to fund the account. I want to make it as easy and mindless for myself as possible, which is also why I\u2019m doing small daily buys rather than larger weekly or monthly buys. I won\u2019t miss the $8 everyday but it will bother me to see $56/week or $240/month to come out. I\u2019m also curious what your guys\u2019 thoughts are on such small purchases, is it even worth it? I mean, at this rate it would take me decades to reach a whole coin, granted the price never went up. I\u2019m involved in crypto in a lot of other ways and have a substantial portfolio relative to my income, just no btc at the moment.

This proposal would reduce the validator count, optimize resource use, and improve efficiency for both solo and large-scale stakers.\n\n\n\n6/ **EIP-7549: Move committee index outside Attestation**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7549](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7549)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: dapplion, Mikhail Kalinin\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 The current mechanism of attestations in Ethereum's Beacon Chain leads to increased computational and storage requirements for validators and ZK circuits.\n\nThe proposal's goal is to optimize Casper FFG (Friendly Finality Gadget) mechanisms that will enhance gas efficiency, scalability, and cryptographic verification.\n\n\n\n7/ **EIP-7623: Increase calldata cost**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7623](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7623)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: Toni Wahrst\u00e4tter, Vitalik Buterin\u00a0\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 Ethereum\u2019s calldata costs have remained unchanged since EIP-2028, leading to inefficiencies as rollups generate large, data-heavy blocks. This proposal adjusts calldata costs to reduce inefficiencies and align with EIP-4844's data availability changes.\n\n\n\n8/ **EIP-7685: General purpose execution layer requests**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7685](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7685)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: lightclients\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 Smart contract-controlled validators often rely on external intermediaries for administrative actions, introducing inefficiencies and risks. This proposal allows direct requests from smart contracts to the CL, streamlining operations and improving safety, scalability, and cross-layer communication for governance automation.\n\n\n\n9/ **EIP-7691: Blob throughput increase**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7691](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7691)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: Parithosh Jayanthi, Toni Wahrst\u00e4tter, Sam Calder-Mason, Andrew Davis, Ansgar Dietrichs\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 This proposal addresses current data availability limitations, offering a short-term scalability improvement for Layer 2 rollups while long-term solutions like peerDAS are being developed.\n\n\n\n10/ **EIP-7702: Set EOA account code**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: Vitalik Buterin, Sam Wilson, Ansgar Dietrichs, lightclients\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 EOAs are less programmable than smart contracts, limiting their efficiency and flexibility. This proposal introduces a mechanism to extend EOAs' functionality, improving gas optimization, security, and interoperability by bridging the gap between EOAs and contract accounts.\n\n\n\n11/ **EIP-7840: Add blob schedule to EL config files**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7840](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7840)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: lightclients\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 Currently, execution clients depend on blob configuration data for some features. Storing this data only in the consensus client leads to inefficiencies and extra API calls between clients for each block. This proposal improves performance by offloading the need for execution and consensus layers to perform excessive data handshakes.", "created_utc": "2025-03-12T17:44:18", "score": 105, "num_comments": 12, "author": "irina_everstake", "permalink": "/r/ethereum/comments/1j9gc4o/ethereum_pectra_upgrade_scope/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1j9gc4o/ethereum_pectra_upgrade_scope/", "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.06250000000000001, "subjectivity": 0.45370082815734986, "sentiment": "neutral"}, "entities": ["ethereum"], "topics": ["author", "proposal", "layer", "block"]}, {"id": "1j9cuge", "title": "Daily General Discussion - March 12, 2025", "body": "**Welcome to the Ethereum Daily General Discussion on** r/ethereum \n\n[https://imgur.com/3y7vezP](https://imgur.com/3y7vezP)\n\nBookmarking this link will always bring you to the current daily:  [https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/about/sticky/?num=2](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/about/sticky/?num=2) \n\nPlease use this thread to discuss Ethereum topics, news, events, and even *price*!\n\nPrice discussion posted elsewhere in the subreddit will **continue to be removed.**\n\nAs always, be constructive. - [Subreddit Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/about/rules/)\n\nWant to stake?

Global financial giant Citi has recently released a forecast that\u2019s sending ripples through financial markets, predicting significant headwinds for South Korea\u2019s economic growth. For those watching the pulse of global finance and its potential impact on the cryptocurrency landscape, this news is critical. Let\u2019s delve into the specifics of Citi\u2019s prediction and understand what challenges lie ahead for the East Asian economic powerhouse. Decoding Citi\u2019s Economic Forecast for South Korea Citi\u2019s latest economic forecast paints a concerning picture for South Korea. While the nation has long been admired for its robust and rapid economic expansion, particularly in technology and manufacturing, the report suggests a looming slowdown. Several factors are contributing to this less optimistic outlook, and understanding them is crucial for anyone tracking global economic trends. This forecast isn\u2019t just about numbers; it\u2019s about real-world impacts on businesses, consumers, and potentially, investment strategies across various sectors, including the volatile cryptocurrency market. What are the Primary Economic Growth Challenges Identified by Citi? Citi\u2019s analysis points to a confluence of factors that are expected to dampen South Korea\u2019s economic momentum. These aren\u2019t isolated issues; they are interconnected challenges that could collectively exert significant pressure. Let\u2019s break down the key areas of concern: Global Economic Slowdown: A major headwind is the anticipated global economic slowdown. As major economies like the US and Europe grapple with inflation and potential recession, demand for South Korean exports, a cornerstone of its economy, is likely to decrease. This external pressure is a primary driver of concern. High Household Debt: South Korea faces a significant challenge with high levels of household debt. Rising interest rates, implemented to combat inflation, are making debt servicing more expensive for households. This could curtail consumer spending, a vital component of economic growth, and potentially lead to financial instability for some households. Aging Population and Low Birth Rate: Demographic shifts are also playing a role. South Korea\u2019s rapidly aging population and alarmingly low birth rate pose long-term structural challenges. A shrinking workforce and increased dependency ratio (ratio of dependents to working-age population) can strain social security systems, reduce productivity growth, and limit overall economic dynamism. Geopolitical Risks: The Korean peninsula remains a region with persistent geopolitical risks. Tensions with North Korea and broader regional uncertainties can impact investor confidence and disrupt trade flows, adding another layer of complexity to South Korea\u2019s economic outlook. Supply Chain Disruptions: While global supply chains have shown some signs of easing, vulnerabilities remain. Further disruptions, whether due to geopolitical events, pandemics, or natural disasters, could disproportionately impact South Korea\u2019s export-oriented economy, particularly its manufacturing sector. Asian Economic Outlook: How Does South Korea Fit In? Citi\u2019s prediction for South Korea isn\u2019t isolated; it\u2019s part of a broader assessment of the Asian Economic Outlook. While Asia is still expected to be a region of relatively strong growth compared to other parts of the world, the pace is projected to moderate. China\u2019s economic slowdown, coupled with global uncertainties, is casting a shadow over the entire region. South Korea, heavily reliant on trade within Asia and globally, is particularly susceptible to these regional and global economic shifts. Understanding the interconnectedness of Asian economies is key to grasping the full implications of Citi\u2019s forecast. Impact on the South Korea Economy: Beyond the Numbers What does this mean for the average person in South Korea, and for businesses operating there? The potential impacts are multifaceted: Reduced Job Creation: Slower economic growth can translate to fewer job opportunities, particularly for young people entering the workforce. Companies may become more cautious about hiring and expansion plans. Lower Wage Growth: Wage growth may stagnate or slow down as companies face tighter margins and reduced profitability in a less robust economic environment. This can impact household incomes and consumer spending power. Increased Business Uncertainty: Businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), may face increased uncertainty and challenges in planning for the future. Investment decisions may be delayed, and some businesses could struggle to survive in a downturn. Potential for Government Intervention: In response to economic challenges, the South Korean government may implement measures to stimulate growth, such as fiscal stimulus, monetary policy adjustments, or structural reforms. The effectiveness of these interventions will be crucial in mitigating the negative impacts. Navigating Economic Growth Challenges: What Can South Korea Do? While Citi\u2019s forecast presents challenges, it\u2019s not a doomsday scenario. South Korea possesses significant strengths and can take proactive steps to navigate these headwinds. Here are potential strategies and actionable insights: Area Actionable Insights Fiscal Policy Implement targeted fiscal measures to support vulnerable households and businesses without exacerbating inflationary pressures. Focus on investments in future growth sectors. Monetary Policy Carefully calibrate monetary policy to balance inflation control with supporting economic growth. Consider the impact of interest rate hikes on household debt and investment. Structural Reforms Accelerate structural reforms to address long-term challenges such as the aging population, low birth rate, and over-reliance on exports. Promote innovation, diversify the economy, and improve productivity. International Cooperation Strengthen international cooperation to mitigate geopolitical risks and promote stable trade relationships. Diversify export markets and reduce reliance on any single economy. Household Debt Management Implement measures to manage household debt levels, such as encouraging responsible borrowing and providing support for debt restructuring where needed. Global Economic Slowdown and its Ripple Effects The anticipated global economic slowdown is a major external factor influencing Citi\u2019s forecast. This isn\u2019t just a South Korean issue; it\u2019s a global trend. As major economies decelerate, the interconnected nature of the global economy means that the impact is felt worldwide. For investors and businesses, this highlights the importance of diversification and risk management. The cryptocurrency market, while often seen as detached from traditional finance, is not immune to these broader economic currents. Investor sentiment, risk appetite, and overall market liquidity can be influenced by global economic conditions. Conclusion: A Moment of Reflection for South Korea\u2019s Economic Trajectory Citi\u2019s prediction serves as a stark reminder that even highly successful economies face periods of challenge. For South Korea, navigating these economic growth challenges will require a combination of prudent policy measures, structural reforms, and resilience. The nation\u2019s ability to adapt and innovate has been proven time and again. While the road ahead may be bumpy, understanding the nature of these challenges, as highlighted by Citi\u2019s forecast, is the first step towards effective solutions. For those watching the global economic stage, South Korea\u2019s response to these headwinds will be a crucial case study in economic management and adaptation in a complex world.

When you enter a casino, a few things likely catch your attention. The vibrant lights, the sound of the slot machines, chips clinking, and dice rolling. Though people visit casinos hoping to strike it big, the outcomes largely depend on luck. However, when it comes to crypto, a digital asset often compared to gambling , the market is much more advanced and requires a clear understanding of its complexities. You might also like: Crypto finally dropped its \u2018bros\u2019 era and made way for a new, inclusive chapter | Opinion When it comes to digital assets, an investor isn\u2019t leaving its desired outcome up to chance. But despite the knowledge needed to navigate digital markets, prospective investors are eager to dive into the market, even without taking the time to research and fully understand its difficulties before jumping in. The rush to invest, along with the hype and trends, can prove to be more harmful than their wallets realize. Just ask anyone who invested in LUNA before its crash in May 2022 how much of a \u201csure thing\u201d that coin was. It\u2019s not enough to treat crypto investment as a game of luck. And if you\u2019re looking to land a big win quickly, it might be time to reassess your overall approach to investing. The hype-fueled boom and bust cycle The early days of crypto were defined by pioneering investment techniques, as enthusiasts saw the promise of a decentralized financial system that didn\u2019t have the original boundaries of traditional financial industries. However, over time, the rise of \u201cget-rich-quick\u201d narratives started to overshadow more methodical decision-making needed to provide digital assets with the legitimacy its users were seeking. Gradually, the speculative nature of crypto continued to create a volatile playground where short-term profits were the main objective. And unfortunately, some never outgrew this mentality . Without a doubt, social media has been a main character in the volatility surrounding the industry. In the niche world of digital assets, its online culture makes it vulnerable to outside commentators. While they might sound like they know it all, in reality, they often provide misleading advice, sometimes driven more by personal gain rather than a genuine intent to share insights. Elon Musk, for example, is a well-known figure in the crypto, with his posts impacting the market almost instantaneously. Last October, a tech news site revealed over 240 complaints of fans who were victims of crypto scams falsely claiming to be affiliated with Musk. While he can\u2019t be held responsible for investors being deceived by these schemes, his influence continues to drive volatility in the market. While we\u2019re only a couple of months into 2025, many are bracing for the final figures that uncover how much scammers managed to steal from investors last year, especially after close to $6 billion was stolen in 2023. With this in mind, how do crypto novices and long-time users avoid a path falling prey to scams and schemes? Avoid getting FOMO\u2019d into a scam The odds in a casino are pretty much painted on the walls, but there are a few ways gamblers can protect themselves from losing their money unless they stop themselves at the door. However, crypto is the opposite, as the odds aren\u2019t as clear, but there are ways users can safeguard themselves. Let\u2019s be honest\u2014crypto hasn\u2019t sorted out the majority of its UX problems. Even the most technologically advanced are often wary of joining, knowing that the ecosystem can be confusing and intimidating to navigate and understand. However, over the last few years, whenever the market hits a peak and surges, FOMO sets in, and people jump into the landscape without any prior knowledge or understanding of the nuances of the space, resulting in them exposing themselves to scams, fraud, and hacking. Investing in crypto isn\u2019t about making a quick dollar or picking up a new interest. It requires a commitment of time and effort to understand the technology and market dynamics and know how to safeguard assets. And without this understanding, an investor will likely fall victim to risks hanging in the shadows. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has yet to mark its 16th anniversary, meaning the industry is still in its infancy. Its early stage indicates it\u2019s constantly evolving, with many characteristics like regulatory frameworks, security standards, and the underlying technologies far from finalized. Just because public figures like President Donald Trump have embraced cryptocurrency doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a foolproof path for everyone. While his election victory fueled Bitcoin\u2019s rise and the support for clearer, more favorable crypto regulations , what\u2019s good for the market doesn\u2019t always translate into benefits for the broader population. While anything can be used to gamble, most of the people who see crypto as a gambling scheme are the ones who don\u2019t understand it, won\u2019t take the time to learn it\u2014and ultimately, may not be suited to use it. We all take gambles in life. The second you do anything, even stepping into a car, you\u2019re putting your life in other people\u2019s hands. However, you\u2019re usually aware of the risks involved with this choice. Believe it or not, the same applies to crypto. It comes down to how much an investor is willing to learn and assess the risks before putting their money on the line. As crypto continues to gain popularity in the mainstream, especially with President Trump in the White House, careful research remains critical. What might initially seem like a guaranteed win can quickly become a costly mistake. The bottom line? The crypto space must remain free of hype and maintain its focus on informed decision-making. While the glamour of quick gains can be tempting to investors trying to come into cash quickly, taking a measured, thoughtful approach is the best way to keep investors sheltered from the volatility that can be masked by the excitement of a market constantly in the spotlight.

Memecoins have shown no signs of recovering any time soon after the apparent crypto market crash in mid-February. Even though the U.S. dollar weakening has sparked a rise in liquidity and improvements in inflation data, the memecoin market remains unaffected, according to the latest Matrixport report . In a previously published report, Matrixport analysts warned traders of an upcoming crypto consolidation phase, specifically one that would affect memecoins. Since then, recent analysis has shown that liquidity in Solana ( SOL )-based automated market makers like Serum has tightened, with Raydium\u2019s total value locked dropping 71%. Meanwhile, Solana\u2019s own TVL has fallen as much as 37%. https://twitter.com/Matrixport_EN/status/1900467807160332738 The rise of global liquidity, measured by the money supply of 28 central banks around the world, would normally provide a boost to alternative investments. Not only that, Matrixport noted that the U.S. inflation report revealed results that were better than expected, despite the fact that uncertain trade policies continue to loom over the possibility of the Fed relaxing their monetary policies. When central banks inject more liquidity into the market or maintain accommodative policies, investors feel more comfortable investing in riskier assets, such as crypto, pushing up prices and trading volumes. However, Matrixport\u2019s analysis shows that affect has not transferred into the memecoin market. In December last year, the overall memecoin market cap reached a peak as high as $137 billion. Since then, it has decreased around $86 billion or more than 60% to only $51.6 billion.

As a result, Matrixport predicts rebounds in the altcoin sector to be limited. Matrixport\u2019s report also highlighted how Pump.fun, the leading memecoin launchpad platform, has seen a sharp decline in its revenue in recent months. \u201cOver the past 12 months, Pump.fun generated revenues exceeding $582 million, making it one of this cycle\u2019s most profitable crypto projects. Recently, however, revenue growth has sharply declined,\u201d wrote Matrixport analysts.

The traditional finance world is buzzing with a significant EUR/USD forecast from none other than Morgan Stanley. While your eyes are glued to Bitcoin charts and DeFi developments, this prediction could ripple through the entire financial landscape, including the cryptocurrency market you\u2019re so keenly invested in. Let\u2019s dive into what this means for you and your crypto portfolio. Why is Morgan Stanley Projecting EUR/USD to 1.12? Morgan Stanley, a global investment banking giant, has released an optimistic outlook on the Euro against the US Dollar, suggesting a potential rise to 1.12. This isn\u2019t just a random guess; it\u2019s based on a confluence of factors they believe will favor the Euro in the coming months. But what exactly are these factors? ECB\u2019s Hawkish Stance: The European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to maintain a relatively hawkish monetary policy to combat inflation. This means potentially continuing with interest rate hikes or maintaining rates at elevated levels, making the Euro more attractive to investors seeking yield. Eurozone Economic Resilience: Despite global economic headwinds, the Eurozone economy has shown surprising resilience in certain sectors. If this trend continues, it could bolster the Euro\u2019s strength. Dollar Weakness Potential: Conversely, the US Dollar might face periods of weakness due to factors like potential shifts in Federal Reserve policy, concerns about US economic growth, or increasing US debt levels. A weaker dollar inherently strengthens other currencies like the Euro in relative terms. Technical Analysis: Beyond fundamental factors, technical chart patterns and market sentiment might also be pointing towards a potential upward trajectory for EUR/USD. To visualize this better, consider the table below showing potential influencing factors: Factor Euro Positive (+) / Dollar Negative (-) Impact on EUR/USD ECB Hawkishness + Upward Pressure Eurozone Resilience + Upward Pressure Potential Dollar Weakness \u2013 Upward Pressure Technical Indicators Mixed (Potentially +) Possible Upward Confirmation Decoding the Forex Market Impact of EUR/USD Movement The EUR/USD pair is the most heavily traded currency pair in the Forex market . Any significant movement, especially one predicted by a major player like Morgan Stanley, sends ripples across the entire Forex landscape. Here\u2019s how: Broader Currency Movements: A stronger Euro can influence other European currencies like GBP, CHF, and SEK. It can also impact emerging market currencies, particularly those with strong trade ties to Europe. Carry Trades: A rising EUR/USD might encourage carry trades where investors borrow in lower-yielding currencies (potentially USD if its strength wanes) to invest in higher-yielding Euro assets. Volatility Spikes: Major forecasts and subsequent market reactions can lead to increased volatility in the Forex market, presenting both risks and opportunities for traders. Commodity Prices: Currency movements can indirectly affect commodity prices, especially those priced in US Dollars. A weaker dollar (potentially resulting from a stronger Euro) can sometimes lead to higher commodity prices. How Does This Relate to the Cryptocurrency Market ? Now, for the million-dollar question: Why should crypto investors care about EUR/USD? The cryptocurrency market , while seemingly independent, is deeply intertwined with traditional finance. Here\u2019s the connection: USD as a Base Currency: A significant portion of cryptocurrency trading is still denominated against the US Dollar (e.g., BTC/USD, ETH/USD). Dollar strength or weakness directly impacts crypto valuations in USD terms. Risk Sentiment: Forex markets are often seen as barometers of global risk sentiment. A shift in EUR/USD can reflect broader market confidence or anxiety, which can spill over into the risk-on crypto market. A stronger Euro, signaling potential Eurozone economic strength, could contribute to a positive risk sentiment. Dollar Index (DXY) Correlation: The Dollar Index (DXY) measures the dollar\u2019s strength against a basket of currencies, with the Euro having the largest weighting. A rising EUR/USD often contributes to a weaker DXY. Historically, there have been times when a weaker DXY has coincided with periods of crypto market growth (though correlation isn\u2019t causation!). Macroeconomic Outlook: Morgan Stanley\u2019s EUR/USD forecast is rooted in macroeconomic analysis. These broader economic trends \u2013 inflation, interest rates, economic growth \u2013 influence both Forex and crypto markets. Trading Opportunities for Crypto Investors A predicted EUR/USD rise can actually unlock some interesting trading opportunities for savvy crypto investors. It\u2019s not just about Forex trading itself; it\u2019s about understanding the broader implications: Forex Diversification: Crypto investors can consider diversifying into Forex trading, specifically EUR/USD. Understanding the dynamics of this pair can add another dimension to your trading portfolio. Hedging Strategies: If you hold crypto assets in USD, a predicted Euro strength could be a signal to consider hedging strategies. This could involve taking positions that benefit from a weaker dollar or stronger Euro. Analyzing Crypto Pairs: Pay attention to crypto pairs beyond USD. For example, EUR/BTC or EUR/ETH. A stronger Euro could influence these pairs, offering unique trading setups. Spotting Market Sentiment Shifts: Monitor how the Forex market reacts to the EUR/USD forecast. This can provide early clues about shifts in broader market sentiment that might precede movements in the crypto market. Navigating Market Volatility and Potential Challenges It\u2019s crucial to remember that forecasts are not guarantees. The market volatility inherent in both Forex and crypto trading means things can change rapidly. Here are some challenges and risks to consider: Forecast Uncertainty: Morgan Stanley\u2019s prediction is an analysis, not a certainty. Economic conditions and unforeseen events can always derail even the most well-reasoned forecasts. Global Events: Geopolitical events, unexpected economic data releases, and black swan events can trigger sharp and sudden movements in EUR/USD, impacting any trading positions. Correlation Breakdown: While there can be correlations between Forex and crypto markets, these correlations are not always consistent and can break down, especially during periods of high volatility. Trading Risks: Both Forex and crypto trading involve significant risks, including leverage risk, market risk, and operational risks. Always trade responsibly and within your risk tolerance. Actionable Insights for Crypto and Forex Traders So, what should you do with this information? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on EUR/USD movements and Forex market news. Follow economic data releases from the Eurozone and the US, and pay attention to ECB and Federal Reserve communications. Technical Analysis: If you\u2019re inclined, incorporate technical analysis of EUR/USD charts into your market research. Look for potential entry and exit points based on technical indicators. Risk Management: Whether you\u2019re trading Forex, crypto, or both, robust risk management is paramount. Use stop-loss orders, manage your position sizes, and never risk more than you can afford to lose. Diversification (Carefully): Consider Forex as a potential diversification avenue, but only if you understand the risks involved and are willing to learn the nuances of Forex trading. Conclusion: Riding the Forex Wave to Crypto Opportunities? Morgan Stanley\u2019s bullish EUR/USD forecast to 1.12 is more than just a Forex market prediction; it\u2019s a potential signal of shifting macroeconomic winds that could influence the cryptocurrency market . By understanding the Forex market impact , identifying trading opportunities , and navigating market volatility wisely, crypto investors can potentially leverage these insights to enhance their trading strategies and portfolio diversification.

In Vermont, state financial regulators have dropped their case against Coinbase, following the SEC\u2019s decision to dismiss its lawsuit over the exchange\u2019s staking services. Meanwhile, in California, a jury has found AML Bitcoin creator Rowland Marcus Andrade guilty of wire fraud and money laundering. Vermont Drops Legal Action Against Coinbase Following SEC\u2019s Case Dismissal The US state of Vermont has officially dropped its \u201cshow cause order\u201d against Coinbase. The action, originally taken as part of a multi-state initiative against the exchange\u2019s staking service, alleged that Coinbase was offering unregistered securities to users. However, Vermont\u2019s Department of Financial Regulation (DFR) announced on March 13 that it would rescind the order, following the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) recent dismissal of its own case against Coinbase. The move comes amid a shifting regulatory landscape, particularly as federal authorities reassess their stance on crypto-related financial products. In its statement, the DFR noted the SEC\u2019s decision to drop its case against Coinbase on Feb. 28, as well as the formation of a new task force designed to guide future regulatory efforts surrounding cryptocurrency products and services. Vermont was one of ten US states that had launched regulatory actions against Coinbase in June 2023 on the same day the SEC filed its lawsuit. The coordinated effort by states including Alabama, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina, Washington, and Wisconsin targeted Coinbase\u2019s staking services, alleging they violated securities laws by operating without proper licensing. The \u201cshow cause order\u201d issued by Vermont required Coinbase to justify why it should not be forced to halt its staking program. However, now that Vermont has opted out, there is speculation that other states may follow suit, especially as regulatory sentiment shifts under new leadership at the SEC. Paul Grewal, Coinbase\u2019s Chief Legal Officer, welcomed Vermont\u2019s decision and urged other states to follow its lead. He further emphasized that while Vermont\u2019s move is a step in the right direction, more action is needed at the federal level to provide clear, comprehensive crypto regulations. The debate over whether staking services constitute securities has been a longstanding point of contention between regulators and the crypto industry. Coinbase has consistently maintained that staking is simply a means for users to participate in network security and earn rewards\u2014a position that Vermont\u2019s latest decision implicitly acknowledges. The SEC\u2019s case against Coinbase was originally part of a broader enforcement push under former Chair Gary Gensler, who had taken an aggressive stance against the crypto industry. However, since his resignation on Jan. 20, there has been a noticeable shift in the agency\u2019s approach. Several crypto firms facing SEC enforcement actions have seen their cases dismissed in recent weeks. One of the latest examples includes crypto trading firm Cumberland DRW, which had its case dropped on March 4. Additionally, the SEC is reportedly concluding its multi-year battle against Ripple Labs, a case that has been ongoing for over four years. In response to the SEC\u2019s pattern of enforcement actions, Coinbase\u2019s Paul Grewal has filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to determine how many crypto-related enforcement actions were initiated under Gensler\u2019s tenure and the associated costs to taxpayers. What\u2019s Next for US Crypto Regulation? With the SEC pulling back and Vermont withdrawing its action, the future of crypto regulation in the US remains uncertain. The creation of a new SEC task force dedicated to cryptocurrency regulation suggests that new rules or clarifications could be on the horizon. Many industry leaders are hopeful that Congress will finally take action to pass clear legislative frameworks for digital assets, which could resolve long-standing ambiguities around staking, decentralized finance (DeFi), and other crypto services. For now, Vermont\u2019s decision represents a significant win for Coinbase and a potential bellwether for other states reconsidering their legal battles against crypto firms. With regulatory attitudes evolving, the crypto industry may soon see the beginning of a new, more favorable regulatory environment in the US. The withdrawal of Vermont\u2019s enforcement action against Coinbase marks a turning point in the battle over crypto staking regulation. While the decision does not establish a nationwide precedent, it signals a shift in regulatory attitudes, especially as the SEC reassesses its stance under new leadership. With Congress facing increasing pressure to pass comprehensive digital asset legislation, all eyes are now on how state and federal regulators will proceed in the coming months. For Coinbase and other crypto firms, Vermont\u2019s decision is not just a victory\u2014it is a sign that the broader regulatory tide may finally be turning in their favor. AML Bitcoin Founder Found Guilty of Wire Fraud and Money Laundering in California Court In other legal news, a California jury has found Rowland Marcus Andrade, the creator of AML Bitcoin, guilty of wire fraud and money laundering. The March 12 verdict, handed down in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, marks the conclusion of a multi-year legal battle against Andrade, who was initially charged in June 2020 for allegedly defrauding investors. The ruling follows revelations that Andrade misled investors about the capabilities and regulatory compliance of AML Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency he claimed would revolutionize the industry by integrating advanced Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols. However, as authorities unraveled his scheme, it became evident that the promised technology never existed, and that Andrade had diverted millions of dollars into personal luxuries. The case against Andrade, which ran parallel to a civil suit filed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), revealed systematic deception designed to entice investors. His company, the NAC Foundation, marketed AML Bitcoin as an innovative digital asset designed to comply with stringent AML and KYC requirements, a key issue in crypto regulation. However, during the trial, prosecutors demonstrated that AML Bitcoin never actually launched, and that Andrade fabricated partnerships to mislead investors. Evidence presented at trial showed that Andrade collected over $2 million from investors during the initial coin offering (ICO) phase between 2017 and 2018. Instead of funding the development of AML Bitcoin, he pocketed the proceeds, spending extravagantly on real estate and high-end automobiles. One of the most damning pieces of evidence was Andrade\u2019s false claim that the Panama Canal Authority was on the verge of adopting AML Bitcoin for transactions involving ships passing through the canal. This nonexistent deal was a key selling point used to entice investors, despite there being no formal agreement between Andrade and the Panamanian government. Adding another layer of controversy, the SEC\u2019s civil case against Andrade was notable for its connection to Jack Abramoff, a notorious political lobbyist who served four years in prison between 2006 and 2010 for a corruption scandal involving mail fraud, conspiracy to bribe public officials, and tax evasion. Abramoff had been working alongside Andrade in promoting AML Bitcoin but eventually pleaded guilty to related charges. A federal judge had stayed the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Andrade in January 2021, pending the outcome of his criminal trial. Now that Andrade has been convicted, the SEC\u2019s case is expected to resume, potentially adding further penalties and restrictions to the disgraced crypto entrepreneur. The Legal Fallout: Andrade Faces Decades in Prison Having remained free on a $75,000 bond since 2020, Andrade is now set to return to court for sentencing on July 22. He faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for wire fraud and 10 years for money laundering, meaning he could spend up to 30 years behind bars. Given the scale of the fraud and the financial losses suffered by investors, prosecutors are likely to seek a lengthy sentence to serve as a warning to others engaged in similar crypto scams. Andrade\u2019s conviction highlights an ongoing issue in the cryptocurrency industry: fraudsters exploiting investor enthusiasm with bold claims and misleading narratives. Over the past decade, dozens of fraudulent ICOs have surfaced, with investors often left with nothing as bad actors vanish with the funds. The case is reminiscent of other high-profile crypto frauds, such as: OneCoin (2014-2017): A $4 billion Ponzi scheme orchestrated by Ruja Ignatova, who is still on the FBI\u2019s Most Wanted List. BitConnect (2016-2018): A multi-billion dollar crypto lending scheme that collapsed in one of the largest exit scams in history. FTX Collapse (2022): Former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is currently facing decades in prison for fraud and mismanagement of customer funds. Regulators have been ramping up their scrutiny of the cryptocurrency sector, with agencies like the SEC, IRS, and FBI increasingly targeting fraudulent schemes. Just this week, the IRS announced new investigations into tax evasion and financial crimes within the crypto industry, signaling tougher enforcement measures against individuals attempting to use digital assets for illicit purposes. Meanwhile, Congress is debating new regulatory frameworks that could provide clearer guidelines for ICOs, staking services, and cryptocurrency compliance\u2014a move that could prevent future cases like AML Bitcoin .", "published_on": "2025-03-14T18:30:00", "url": "https://coinpaper.com/7990/vermont-drops-case-against-coinbase-as-crypto-regulations-shift", "source": "coinpaper", "categories": ["REGULATION", "EXCHANGE", "BTC", "BUSINESS", "TOKEN SALE"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.03826736755308186, "subjectivity": 0.41409039373325096, "sentiment": "neutral"}, "entities": ["bitcoin", "ripple"], "topics": ["vermont", "andrade", "case", "coinbase"]}, {"id": "41640401", "title": "Sanctions Push Russia Toward Crypto in Oil Trade With China and India", "body": "As global sanctions continue to restrict financial dealings of Russia, crypto has emerged as a crucial tool for facilitating international trade. According to a Reuters report, Russian oil companies are increasingly turning to Bitcoin (BTC) and Tether (USDT) to bypass restrictions and settle transactions with key partners in China and India. Multiple sources with direct knowledge of the matter reveal that at least one major Russian oil trader handles tens of millions of dollars worth of crypto transactions monthly. These deals, previously undisclosed, highlight a growing trend in sanctioned economies using digital assets to circumvent traditional financial barriers. Russia\u2019s finance ministry had publicly acknowledged in late 2024 that Bitcoin could be used for foreign trade, but the extent of its application in oil transactions had remained under wraps\u2014until now. How Crypto Is Powering Russia Oil Exports Reuters\u2019 investigation sheds light on the intricate web of intermediaries managing these transactions. Instead of direct crypto payments between Russia\u2019s oil exporters and buyers, a multi-step process ensures anonymity and efficiency: A Chinese buyer of Russian oil makes a payment in yuan to an offshore account managed by a trading company. This intermediary converts the yuan into cryptocurrency, typically USDT or BTC. The funds are then transferred to another account, which routes them to a third account in Russia before converting the funds into rubles. This indirect approach allows Russian firms to sidestep Western-controlled financial networks, which have largely cut off the country from dollar-based transactions. Crypto\u2019s Role in Global Trade Beyond Sanctions One of Reuters\u2019 sources suggests that Russia\u2019s use of crypto in oil trading isn\u2019t just a reaction to sanctions\u2014it\u2019s a long-term strategy. Even if restrictions are lifted, digital assets provide a faster and more efficient way to settle international transactions, reducing reliance on Western banking systems. Meanwhile, Russia\u2019s stance on cryptocurrency continues to evolve. The Bank of Russia recently proposed allowing high-net-worth individuals with at least $1.1 million in assets to invest in crypto, signaling a shift in regulatory approach. Despite banning most crypto transactions in 2021 , China remains a leader in Bitcoin mining. Some experts speculate that as Bitcoin\u2019s role in global finance grows, China may reconsider its stance, especially with reports suggesting that the Chinese government holds at least 193,000 BTC.

As one of the most established cryptocurrencies, XRP shows resilience despite regulatory challenges and market fluctuations. The steady rise in XRP wallet addresses reflects expanding participation in the network. Each XRP address represents a unique holder or entity interacting with the blockchain, whether for investment, cross-border transactions, institutional adoption, or decentralized applications (dApps). This dramatic rise in addresses suggests growing interest in XRP\u2019s use cases, particularly in remittances, financial settlements, and enterprise-level blockchain solutions.

XRP was designed for speed, scalability, and low transaction costs, making it a preferred asset for financial institutions seeking alternatives to traditional banking systems. Ripple, the company behind XRP, has established partnerships with major banks and payment service providers, further strengthening XRP\u2019s utility in the global financial landscape. The increasing number of addresses may indicate heightened institutional involvement, as banks and remittance firms integrate XRP into their payment corridors. Ripple\u2019s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution , which uses XRP as a bridge currency for instant international transactions, has been expanding its footprint, potentially attracting more institutional wallets. Retail Adoption and Growing XRP Community Beyond institutional use, XRP\u2019s growing retail adoption also contributes to the uptick in address creation. Retail investors, developers, and blockchain enthusiasts continue to explore XRP for its fast transaction speeds and robust ecosystem. The XRP Ledger supports smart contract functionality through Hooks and other developer tools, opening avenues for dApps, tokenization, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. The XRP community is one of the most active and dedicated in the cryptocurrency space, driving ecosystem growth through educational initiatives, community-driven projects, and ongoing advocacy, including community-led educational programs, collaborative innovation projects, and continuous promotion of XRP through various channels. The recent milestone in address count suggests that new participants are joining the ecosystem, reinforcing the network\u2019s long-term viability.

However, key legal victories for Ripple in 2023 have helped restore market confidence, encouraging investors and institutions to re-engage with XRP. The growing number of addresses suggests that some individuals who were previously cautious due to regulatory uncertainty may be returning to the market, contributing to the increased activity. As global regulatory clarity improves, XRP is well-positioned to capitalize on the increased certainty, with clearer guidelines on digital assets likely to drive growth and adoption. Countries like Japan, the UAE , and certain European jurisdictions have already embraced XRP-friendly regulations, fostering a more supportive environment for adoption. The Road Ahead for XRP With the total number of XRP addresses reaching 6.87 million, the network is experiencing strong momentum. However, sustained growth will depend on continued innovation, ecosystem development, and regulatory progress. The expansion of XRP\u2019s use cases in payments, tokenization, and DeFi will likely play a crucial role in shaping its future. As the crypto market evolves, XRP\u2019s ability to maintain high transaction efficiency, attract institutional partnerships, and adapt to emerging blockchain trends will determine its long-term position in the industry. For now, the latest milestone marks another step forward for one of the most resilient digital assets in the space. XRP\u2019s growing adoption and expanding user base reinforce its relevance in the evolving financial landscape. Whether through retail investors, institutions, or developers, the increasing number of addresses highlights a broader recognition of XRP\u2019s potential as a transformative blockchain asset.

With President Trump unveiling a digital assets stockpile featuring altcoins like XRP, ADA and SOL, speculation is mounting that Ripple could become the first major altcoin that will join this reserve. In this article, we analyze how high the XRP price could go if this happens. How High Will XRP Price Rally if US Government Buys Ripple The SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit is nearing its end according to crypto reporter Eleanor Terrett. She noted that the lawsuit was being wrapped up and could be over soon with a possible $125M settlement. Meanwhile, last week, a White House statement outlined several ways that it would obtain altcoins for the digital assets stockpile. This includes a \u201ccivil money penalty imposed by any agency without further executive or legislative action.\u201d If the US government uses these funds to buy Ripple, XRP will be the first token that the US government holds in its digital assets stockpile. This is bound to boost investor confidence and the Ripple network adoption , leading to a massive XRP price rally past its all-time high of $3.40. Grok AI notes that this purchase would ignite a major bullish breakout, potentially leading to XRP price doubling in price. It stated, \u201cThe news will ignite a full bullish breakout, doubling the price to $4.62, akin to the 2023 ruling response, as traders anticipate broader adoption.\u201d At the same time, DeepSeek AI notes that, \u201cIf the price increases by 50% due to the initial purchase and another 100% due to trader reaction, the price could rise to $6.93.\u201d The end of the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit and endorsement by the US government will also boost Ripple\u2019s IPO plans. This IPO would ignite yet another rally, making it likely for the XRP price to hit $10 and attain an over $580 billion market cap to emerge the largest altcoin. XRP Analysis Amid Bullish Breakout XRP price is showing signs of bullish momentum, steadily climbing toward the upper boundary of its descending parallel channel. Buyers stepped in around the $2 support level, and the altcoin now seems prime for an upward momentum. The RSI is trending higher and the AO indicator also shows that bulls are gaining strength. If Ripple price rebounds and breaks out above $2.50 to make a decisive close above the upper trendline of the descending channel, the altcoin could rally again to the key Fibonacci levels of 78.6% and 123.6% Fibonacci levels of $3 and $3.37, respectively. However, if sellers prevent this breakout attempt, XRP price could drop again to retest the $2 support level before another upswing. Traders should watch out for a sustained momentum in the RSI to confirm the bullish trend. XRP/USDT: 4-hour Chart While the short-term trend shows mixed sentiment around the XRP price, this altcoin could register a massive gain if the end of the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit leads to a $125M purchase by the US government.

And right now, the forex market is sending signals that crypto investors should heed, particularly concerning the EUR/USD pair. The EUR/USD sentiment is demonstrably weakening, creating ripples that can affect broader market confidence. Let\u2019s dive into why this is happening and what it means for you. Why is EUR/USD Sentiment Taking a Hit? The current downturn in EUR/USD sentiment isn\u2019t happening in a vacuum. Several interconnected factors are at play, creating a perfect storm of uncertainty. Primarily, anxieties surrounding international trade and internal German political dynamics are casting a shadow over the Euro. Tariff Tensions Resurface: The specter of trade wars, particularly concerning tariffs, is back on the horizon. Any hint of increased tariffs, especially between major economies, sends shivers through the forex market. Why? Because tariffs disrupt established trade flows, impacting economic growth and, consequently, currency valuations. When traders anticipate tariffs, they often become risk-averse, leading to a flight from currencies perceived as vulnerable. German Political Landscape in Focus: Germany, the economic powerhouse of the Eurozone, is facing its own set of political challenges. Political instability or even perceived weakness in the German government can undermine confidence in the Euro. Investors look to Germany for stability, and any signs of cracks in this foundation can erode EUR/USD sentiment . Economic Data Disappointments: While not explicitly mentioned in the title, underlying economic data always plays a crucial role. If economic indicators from the Eurozone, particularly Germany, start to underperform expectations, it further dampens the outlook for the Euro and contributes to negative EUR/USD sentiment . Tariff Concerns: The Sword of Damocles Hanging Over EUR/USD Tariff concerns are not just abstract economic theories; they have real-world consequences for currency valuations. Imagine a scenario where new tariffs are imposed between the US and Europe. This could lead to: Reduced Trade Volumes: Tariffs make imported goods more expensive, potentially decreasing trade between regions. Lower trade volumes can negatively impact economic growth in both the Eurozone and the US, although the specific impact can vary. Supply Chain Disruptions: Businesses that rely on international supply chains may face increased costs and logistical challenges, affecting profitability and potentially leading to economic slowdown. Currency Devaluation (Potentially): In anticipation of economic headwinds from tariffs, investors might reduce their exposure to currencies of the affected regions, leading to a potential devaluation, or at least a weakening, of currencies like the Euro. For EUR/USD, heightened tariff concerns often translate to increased volatility and a potential downward pressure on the Euro. Traders closely monitor any news or statements related to trade policy, reacting swiftly to perceived threats. German Politics: A Source of Euro Uncertainty? The stability of German politics is often seen as a bedrock for the Eurozone economy. However, any signs of political fragility in Germany can introduce uncertainty and negatively impact the EUR/USD sentiment . What kind of political scenarios could worry the markets? Coalition Instability: If the ruling coalition in Germany appears shaky or faces internal divisions, it can raise questions about the government\u2019s ability to implement economic reforms or maintain fiscal discipline. Rise of Populist Movements: An increase in support for political parties that advocate for policies diverging from the established economic consensus could also create unease among investors. Succession Concerns: Changes in leadership, particularly at the top levels of government, can sometimes trigger market jitters until a clear and stable path forward is established. While Germany remains a stable democracy, even subtle shifts in the political landscape are scrutinized by forex traders for potential implications on the Euro and, consequently, the EUR/USD sentiment . Navigating Forex Volatility: What Does This Mean for Traders? The confluence of tariff concerns and German political dynamics is creating a period of heightened forex volatility for the EUR/USD pair. For traders, this presents both challenges and opportunities. Challenges: Increased Risk: Higher volatility means greater price swings, increasing the risk of unexpected losses if positions are not managed carefully. Whipsaws and False Signals: Volatile markets are prone to whipsaws, where prices move sharply in one direction only to reverse quickly. This can lead to false trading signals and premature stop-outs. Emotional Trading: The rapid price fluctuations can trigger emotional responses, leading to impulsive trading decisions that are often detrimental. Opportunities: Potential for Profit: Volatility, while risky, also creates opportunities for profit. Skilled traders who can accurately anticipate market movements can capitalize on these price swings. Increased Trading Volume: Periods of uncertainty often see a rise in trading volume as market participants actively adjust their positions. Higher volume can sometimes lead to tighter spreads and better execution. Diversification Benefits: For cryptocurrency investors, understanding forex volatility, particularly in EUR/USD, can offer diversification insights. Forex markets can sometimes react differently to global events than crypto markets, providing a broader perspective on risk and opportunity. Currency Market Trends: Beyond EUR/USD While the focus is on EUR/USD, it\u2019s crucial to remember that the currency market trends are interconnected. What happens with EUR/USD can influence other currency pairs and even spill over into other asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Here are some broader currency market trends to keep an eye on: Dollar Strength/Weakness: The US Dollar\u2019s performance is a dominant factor in global forex markets. Factors influencing the dollar, such as US interest rate policy and economic data, will have a ripple effect across all currency pairs, including EUR/USD. Emerging Market Currencies: Developments in emerging market economies and their currencies can also indirectly impact major pairs like EUR/USD. Global risk sentiment often flows through emerging markets first. Central Bank Policies: Monetary policy decisions by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve (Fed) are key drivers of currency market trends . Keep track of interest rate announcements, quantitative easing programs, and forward guidance from these central banks. Actionable Insights: How to Navigate the Current EUR/USD Landscape So, what actionable steps can traders take to navigate the current challenging EUR/USD sentiment and forex volatility ? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest news and analysis concerning tariff developments, German politics, and key economic data releases from both the Eurozone and the US. Risk Management is Paramount: In volatile markets, robust risk management is crucial. Use stop-loss orders, manage position sizes carefully, and avoid over-leveraging. Technical Analysis: Employ technical analysis tools to identify potential support and resistance levels, trend lines, and chart patterns that can help in making informed trading decisions. Diversification (Across Forex Pairs): If you are actively trading forex, consider diversifying across different currency pairs to reduce concentration risk related to EUR/USD. Consider Options Strategies: Options trading strategies can be used to manage risk and potentially profit from volatility in EUR/USD, although options trading involves its own set of complexities and risks. Conclusion: Prepare for Continued EUR/USD Turbulence The current weakening EUR/USD sentiment , fueled by tariff concerns and uncertainties surrounding German politics , suggests a period of continued forex volatility for this major currency pair. Traders need to be prepared for potentially sharp price swings and maintain a disciplined approach to risk management. By staying informed, employing sound trading strategies, and understanding the broader currency market trends , it is possible to navigate these turbulent times and potentially find opportunities even amidst the uncertainty. The key is to remain vigilant and adapt to the evolving market dynamics.

Another trader has profited from leveraged positions on the same token and Ethereum (ETH). In a March 14 X post , on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain reported that a whale sold off their entire HYPE holdings, losing more than $1.8 million in the process. Between February 25 and March 4, the investor spent 5.08 million USDC to acquire 266,000 HYPE at an average price of $19.08 per token. About 11 hours before Lookonchain\u2019s update, they sold their holdings for 3.27 million USDC at an average price of $12.27 per token to make the realized losses. The trader could have decided to let go of his holdings owing to the weeks of HYPE\u2019s downtrend, which has seen its price decline by 28.7% over the last two weeks, per CoinGecko data. Whale cashes out profits on Hyperliquid and Ethereum Not everyone felt the effects of HYPE\u2019s weekly bloodbath, as another trader has counted a month of gains, making leveraged trades on the Hyperliquid platform. According to Lookonchain, this individual has made a total profit of $16.39 million from February 14 to date, through eight trades across two wallets, with every single transaction proving profitable. The market tracker\u2019s chart analysis shows that they made the most money from March 1 to March 3. The whale deposited about $6.5 million on Hyperliquid and withdrew $13.74 million by longing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Yield Guild Games (YGG). During those 48 hours, YGG went up 38%, and BTC went from about $85,000 to $93,000. This investor went long on both ETH and HYPE around 9 p.m. UTC on Thursday, making another $1.18 million. HYPE selling pressures soar, indicators largely bearish The coin\u2019s temporary rebound to $14.85 three days ago was not enough to push the token to a rally, and it continues to flash red. The crypto reached an all-time high level at $34.96 last December, but has now fallen below the $15 mark, as bears continue to push the boundaries of the bulls\u2019 territory. The ongoing sell-off has pushed HYPE into extremely oversold territory. The token\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 9.94, an indication of severe overselling. Its strong Average Directional Index (ADX) reading of 100 suggests that bearish momentum remains dominant, leaving little room for an immediate recovery. Investors may have a reason to smile after the token went up by 10.7% in the last 24 hours, but their hopes for a more defined price uptrend is thwarted by a negative 14.49% momentum reading on the monthly chart. Trading volume remains below average at 0.72x, indicating that buyers are hesitant to step in. Per TradingView\u2019s technical indicators , HYPE\u2019s 10-day exponential moving average stands at 14.577, while the simple moving average for the same period is at 14.346, both spelling bearish conditions. Longer-term moving averages, including the 30-day and 50-day, remain well above current price levels, with the simple 50-day moving average sitting at 21.481, showing that HYPE is trading well below historical support levels. For any potential recovery, traders will be watching the $12.69 pivot level as a threshold to push its price up. Short-term resistance is expected at $13.23 and $14.14, which could limit any upward movement, while a more substantial resistance zone begins at $21.03. Conservative traders may prefer to wait for stronger confirmation of a reversal, which would require the RSI to recover above 30, a decisive break above the $12.69 pivot, and a notable increase in trading volume beyond the daily average. Until these conditions are met, HYPE bears will still have control over the market, with no clear signs of immediate recovery. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

A Tron (TRX) address, holding a substantial 11 million USDT, has been frozen. This move, as revealed by the crypto tracking platform MistTrack on X (formerly Twitter), is reportedly due to suspicions linking the address to nefarious phishing activities. What does this mean for the crypto space, and more importantly, for you as a crypto user? Let\u2019s dive deep into this developing story. Urgent Tether Freeze on Tron Address: Unpacking the Situation The news of Tether freezing a Tron address has sent ripples through the crypto community. But what exactly happened? Here\u2019s a breakdown of the key facts: The Freeze: Tether, responsible for issuing USDT, the most widely used stablecoin, has frozen a specific Tron network address. Significant Amount: The frozen address contained approximately 11 million USDT, a considerable sum indicating potentially large-scale operations. Phishing Suspicions: Crypto tracking firm MistTrack flagged the address, suggesting a correlation between its activities and phishing schemes. Platform Announcement: MistTrack made the announcement publicly on X, bringing immediate attention to the incident. This action by Tether highlights the ongoing battle against illicit activities within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. But why is Tether taking such measures, and what are the broader implications? Why Tether Takes Action Against Suspicious USDT Addresses Tether\u2019s decision to freeze the Tron address holding 11M USDT is not arbitrary. It\u2019s rooted in a commitment to maintaining the integrity and security of the USDT stablecoin and the wider crypto market. Here are some crucial reasons behind such actions: Combating Illicit Activities: Cryptocurrencies, while offering immense potential, can unfortunately be exploited for illegal activities like phishing, scams, and money laundering. Tether, as a major player, takes responsibility in curbing such misuse. Regulatory Compliance: Stablecoin issuers are increasingly under regulatory scrutiny. Freezing addresses linked to suspicious activities demonstrates a proactive approach to compliance and cooperation with law enforcement agencies. Protecting Users: Phishing scams can lead to significant financial losses for individuals. By freezing addresses associated with these activities, Tether aims to protect users from becoming victims of fraud. Maintaining Trust: The credibility of USDT, and by extension, the stablecoin market, depends on trust. Taking swift action against illicit activities helps maintain this trust and confidence in the system. However, it\u2019s important to remember that freezing an address is a serious step, and it\u2019s usually taken after careful consideration and investigation. Platforms like MistTrack play a vital role in identifying and flagging potentially malicious addresses. Tron Address and the USDT Freeze: What is the Connection? The fact that the frozen address is on the Tron network is also noteworthy. Tron has become a popular blockchain for USDT transactions due to its lower fees and faster transaction spTether freezeeeds compared to some other networks. This popularity, however, also makes it a target for illicit activities. Here\u2019s why the Tron network is relevant in this context: USDT on Tron: A significant portion of USDT in circulation exists on the Tron blockchain. Its efficiency and cost-effectiveness have made it a preferred choice for many users and exchanges. Transaction Volume: The high volume of USDT transactions on Tron means there\u2019s a greater potential for both legitimate and illegitimate activities to occur. Accessibility: While accessibility is a benefit, it can also be exploited by those seeking to move funds quickly and discreetly, including funds from phishing scams. Therefore, while the Tron network itself is not inherently problematic, its characteristics make it a landscape where vigilance and security measures are paramount. The Tron Foundation and the wider community are continuously working on enhancing network security and combating illicit activities. Phishing Activities and Crypto: A Dangerous Combination Phishing, a deceptive tactic to steal sensitive information, is a persistent threat in the digital world, and the cryptocurrency space is no exception. How does phishing manifest in crypto, and why is it so dangerous? Deceptive Tactics: Phishing typically involves creating fake websites, emails, or messages that mimic legitimate platforms (like exchanges or wallets) to trick users into revealing their private keys, passwords, or seed phrases. Financial Gain: The goal of crypto phishing is almost always financial gain. Once attackers obtain access to a user\u2019s wallet or account, they can drain funds quickly. Emotional Manipulation: Phishing attacks often employ urgency, fear, or excitement to cloud judgment and pressure victims into acting without thinking critically. Evolving Techniques: Phishing methods are constantly evolving, becoming more sophisticated and harder to detect. This requires users to be perpetually vigilant and informed. The connection between the frozen Tron address and suspected phishing activities underscores the need for robust security measures and user education in the crypto space. Platforms like MistTrack are crucial in identifying and tracking these threats. Crypto Security: Actionable Insights to Protect Yourself News like the Tether USDT freeze on a Tron address serves as a stark reminder of the importance of crypto security. What can you do to protect yourself from phishing and other threats? Verify Website URLs: Always double-check the website address before entering any sensitive information. Look for HTTPS and the correct domain name. Beware of Suspicious Emails and Messages: Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages asking for personal information or urging immediate action. Legitimate platforms rarely ask for sensitive details via email. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Use 2FA on all your crypto accounts for an extra layer of security. Use Hardware Wallets: For long-term storage of significant crypto holdings, consider using hardware wallets, which offer enhanced security by keeping your private keys offline. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with the latest crypto security threats and best practices. Reputable crypto news sources and security blogs are valuable resources. By taking proactive steps and staying vigilant, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to phishing and other crypto scams. Remember, in the world of crypto, security is paramount. Conclusion: A Call for Vigilance in the Crypto World The Tether freeze of a Tron address holding 11 million USDT due to suspected phishing activities is a significant event. It underscores the ongoing challenges in crypto security and the proactive measures being taken by major players like Tether to combat illicit activities. This incident serves as a critical reminder for all crypto users to remain vigilant, informed, and proactive in securing their digital assets. The fight against crypto crime is a continuous effort, requiring collaboration, innovation, and unwavering attention to security best practices.

The fundraising campaign, which began in October 2024, underwent multiple phases, with adjustments to the initial funding goal and additional token offerings to accommodate shifting market demand. Donald Trump\u2019s World Liberty Financial Closes $550M Fundraising Round President Donald Trump\u2019s crypto project, World Liberty Financial, has successfully concluded its fundraising efforts with a substantial $550 million raised. The initiative initially targeted $300 million but faced challenges in early stages, leading to a revised goal. Despite these hurdles, subsequent offerings sparked renewed investor interest, allowing WLFI to exceed its revised expectations by a significant margin. The sale\u2019s first phase ended on January 20, distributing 20% of the total token supply. High-profile investors, including Justin Sun, contributed to the early momentum. The surge in demand led to an additional issuance of 5 billion tokens on the same day, priced at $0.05 each, which were nearly sold out by March 13. This development comes just days after the Trump-backed crypto project announced the SUI Strategic Reserve , further solidifying its commitment to decentralized finance. The move has sparked excitement in the crypto community, driving a notable surge in SUI\u2019s price. Token Lock-up and Utility Details World Liberty Financial has implemented a 12-month lock-up period for all purchased tokens, a move that prevents any immediate trading and reflects a cautious approach to market integration. This governance token enables holders to submit and vote on proposals within the WLFI Protocol. However, it does not provide financial returns, ownership rights, or any direct economic benefits, emphasizing its utility strictly within governance. The tokens require an ERC-compatible wallet for transactions, and investors had to complete necessary KYC and AML verifications to participate. More so, token distribution for designated wallets was scheduled for the end of the sale period, with all buyers fully responsible for the risks associated with their investment. Market Challenges and Portfolio Performance Despite raising a significant sum, World Liberty Financial faced setbacks as its cryptocurrency portfolio experienced substantial losses. Initially, the project allocated $336 million to acquire various digital assets. However, market declines led to a devaluation, with the total value dropping to $226 million as of March 10. Ethereum, which constituted 65% of WLFI\u2019s holdings, saw a decline from an average purchase price of $3,240 per token to around $1,896. This drop impacted the overall value of the portfolio, contributing to the $110 million loss. Other assets in the portfolio also suffered from the downturn, underscoring the volatility in the crypto markets. However, despite the challenges, earlier today, Donald Trump\u2019s DeFi project acquired 541,242 SEI tokens, pushing SEI price up by 7%. This investment underscores WLFI\u2019s continued confidence in the altcoin market, even as its broader crypto portfolio faces losses.

The Green Mountain State has decided to drop its legal action against the crypto giant concerning its staking offerings. This news, shared by Coinbase\u2019s Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Paul Grewal, marks a potentially pivotal moment in the ongoing debate about crypto regulation in the United States. Is this dismissal a sign of changing tides in how staking services are viewed legally? Let\u2019s dive into the details of this developing story and explore what it means for Coinbase, the broader crypto landscape, and the future of staking services . Why is the Vermont Coinbase Case Significant for Crypto Regulation? The dismissal of the Vermont case against Coinbase isn\u2019t just a win for the exchange; it carries broader implications for crypto regulation across the U.S. Here\u2019s why this development is noteworthy: Validation of Coinbase\u2019s Stance: Coinbase has consistently argued that its staking services are not securities. Vermont dropping the legal action can be interpreted as a tacit acknowledgment of this position, or at least a recognition that pursuing the case might be legally challenging. Precedent Setting Potential: While each state\u2019s regulatory environment is unique, a dismissal like this in Vermont could influence other states\u2019 approaches to regulating crypto staking. It may deter other states from pursuing similar legal actions without stronger grounds. Fuel for Industry Advocacy: This victory provides ammunition for Coinbase and other crypto firms to advocate for clearer and more favorable crypto regulation at both the state and federal levels. It strengthens their argument that existing securities laws are ill-suited for innovative crypto services like staking. Investor Confidence Boost: Positive legal developments, like this dismissal, can boost investor confidence in Coinbase and the crypto market in general. It signals a potentially less hostile regulatory environment, which is crucial for market growth and stability. What Exactly are Staking Services and Why are They Under Regulatory Scrutiny? To understand the Vermont case and its significance, it\u2019s essential to grasp what staking services are and why they\u2019ve become a regulatory focal point. In simple terms: Staking Explained: Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Networks: Many modern cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum, operate on a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. This is an energy-efficient alternative to Proof-of-Work (used by Bitcoin). Validating Transactions: In PoS, users can \u201cstake\u201d their crypto holdings to participate in validating transactions on the blockchain and securing the network. Earning Rewards: By staking, users earn rewards, typically in the form of additional units of the staked cryptocurrency. This is often likened to earning interest on savings. Staking Services by Exchanges: Crypto exchanges like Coinbase offer staking services , making it easier for users to participate in staking without needing technical expertise. They pool users\u2019 assets and handle the technical complexities of staking, distributing rewards proportionally. Regulatory Scrutiny: Securities or Not? The central regulatory question is whether staking services constitute securities under existing laws. If deemed securities, they would be subject to stringent registration and compliance requirements. SEC\u2019s Position: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been actively investigating and taking enforcement actions against crypto firms offering staking services, arguing that they often meet the definition of securities. State-Level Actions: Alongside federal scrutiny, some U.S. states, like Vermont, have also initiated legal actions related to staking services, adding another layer of complexity for crypto exchanges. Paul Grewal\u2019s Perspective: A Call for Crypto Legislation Paul Grewal , Coinbase\u2019s CLO, has been a vocal advocate for regulatory clarity in the crypto space. His statement on X regarding the Vermont case underscores Coinbase\u2019s consistent position and highlights the need for legislative action. Key takeaways from Grewal\u2019s statement: Consistent Stance: Grewal reiterated that Coinbase has always maintained that its staking services are not securities. This dismissal from Vermont appears to validate this long-held position. Urgency for Legislation: He emphasized the pressing need for Congress to step in and pass comprehensive crypto legislation . Grewal argues that such legislation should specifically address the unique characteristics of crypto services like staking, moving beyond applying potentially outdated securities laws. Innovation vs. Regulation: The call for legislation reflects the broader industry concern that overly broad or ill-fitting regulations could stifle innovation in the rapidly evolving crypto sector. A clear legal framework is seen as essential for fostering responsible growth and protecting consumers without hindering progress. What Does This Mean for the Future of Coinbase Staking and Crypto? The Vermont dismissal, while a positive development, is just one piece of the larger regulatory puzzle. What can we realistically expect moving forward? Potential Benefits: Reduced Legal Uncertainty: This win, along with potential future positive legal outcomes, can gradually reduce the legal uncertainty surrounding Coinbase staking and similar services. Focus on Federal Legislation: The industry\u2019s focus is likely to intensify on pushing for federal crypto legislation . Vermont\u2019s decision might embolden lawmakers to consider more nuanced approaches to crypto regulation. Continued SEC Scrutiny: It\u2019s important to note that this Vermont case doesn\u2019t necessarily signal a change in the SEC\u2019s stance. The SEC is likely to continue its regulatory efforts concerning staking and other crypto services. Global Regulatory Landscape: The U.S. regulatory environment is just one aspect. The global regulatory landscape for crypto is diverse and evolving. Coinbase and other exchanges operate internationally and must navigate varying rules and regulations across different jurisdictions. Actionable Insights: What Should Crypto Users and Investors Do? For crypto users and investors, the Vermont dismissal and the broader crypto regulation debate offer several actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments at both the state and federal levels. Follow industry news, legal updates, and statements from regulatory bodies like the SEC. Understand Staking Risks: Whether you use Coinbase staking or other platforms, understand the risks involved, including regulatory risks and platform-specific risks. Advocate for Clarity: If you are a crypto user or investor, consider engaging with policymakers and advocating for clear and sensible crypto regulations that foster innovation while protecting consumers. Diversify and Manage Risk: As always in the crypto space, diversification and prudent risk management are key. Don\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket, and be prepared for regulatory changes that could impact the market. Conclusion: A Ray of Hope, But the Journey Continues Vermont dismissing its legal action against Coinbase over staking is undoubtedly a positive signal for the exchange and potentially for the broader crypto industry. It offers a ray of hope for a more balanced and informed approach to crypto regulation . However, it\u2019s crucial to remember that this is just one battle in an ongoing regulatory journey. The need for comprehensive crypto legislation in the U.S. remains as pressing as ever.

A prominent voice in Congress, Rep. Gerry Connolly, is raising serious alarms about a proposed strategic crypto reserve . His concerns, outlined in a recent letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, center around potential conflicts of interest involving former President Donald Trump. This move has sparked debate and questions about the true intentions behind this financial strategy. Let\u2019s unpack the details and understand why this proposal is facing such strong opposition and what it could mean for the future of cryptocurrency. Why is Gerry Connolly Sounding the Alarm on the Crypto Reserve? Rep. Gerry Connolly , a Democrat representing Virginia, has taken a firm stance against the U.S. Treasury\u2019s plans for a strategic crypto reserve . In a letter dated March 13, addressed to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Connolly articulated his deep apprehensions about the initiative. According to a press release from the Oversight Committee Democrats, Connolly\u2019s primary worry revolves around the potential for conflicts of interest involving President Donald Trump. He argues that this reserve, instead of serving the American public\u2019s best interests, could become a lucrative venture primarily benefiting the former president and his influential donors. Key Concerns Raised by Rep. Connolly: Conflict of Interest: Connolly explicitly points to potential conflicts of interest related to President Trump, suggesting the reserve could be designed to enrich him and his associates rather than benefit the nation. Lack of Transparency and Consultation: The Congressman emphasized that the proposal for a strategic crypto reserve was developed without any consultation with Congress. This lack of transparency raises questions about the decision-making process and the rationale behind the initiative. Benefit to Whom?: Connolly questions who would truly benefit from this reserve, asserting it\u2019s unlikely to serve the broader American public and instead could be a vehicle for private gain. What is a Strategic Crypto Reserve and Why Now? The concept of a strategic crypto reserve , while still vague in its specifics, suggests the U.S. Treasury might be considering holding a significant amount of cryptocurrency assets, similar to how nations maintain reserves of gold or foreign currencies. The rationale behind such a move is not explicitly stated in the available information, but we can infer potential motivations: Possible Reasons for a Crypto Reserve: Geopolitical Strategy: In an increasingly digital world, nations might view cryptocurrency holdings as a strategic asset in international finance and trade. Financial Innovation: Governments may want to engage more directly with the cryptocurrency market, possibly to understand and regulate it better, or even to leverage its potential for economic growth. Market Influence: Holding a substantial crypto reserve could give the U.S. Treasury more influence in the cryptocurrency market, potentially impacting prices and market trends. However, without clear communication from the US Treasury , these remain speculative. Rep. Connolly\u2019s letter underscores the urgency for clarity and public discussion before such a significant financial strategy is implemented. The Shadow of Trump Conflict: A Legitimate Concern? The core of Gerry Connolly \u2019s argument rests on the potential Trump conflict of interest. While the specifics of how President Trump might benefit are not detailed in the press release, the implication is clear: Connolly suspects that individuals connected to or aligned with Trump could leverage the strategic crypto reserve for personal financial gain. Understanding the Conflict Concerns: Lack of Detail: The absence of specifics from the Treasury regarding the reserve\u2019s structure and management raises suspicions. Who would manage the reserve? How would assets be acquired and secured? Lack of clarity fuels concerns about potential manipulation. Political Climate: Given the highly polarized political landscape in the U.S., any initiative perceived as benefiting a specific political faction, especially one associated with controversial figures, is likely to face intense scrutiny and opposition. Public Trust: Concerns about conflicts of interest can erode public trust in government institutions. Connolly\u2019s letter appears to be an attempt to preemptively address these trust issues and demand transparency. Whether these concerns are substantiated or not, the fact that a senior member of Congress is publicly voicing them highlights the sensitivity and potential risks associated with establishing a strategic crypto reserve without proper oversight and public discourse. Cryptocurrency Regulation and the Role of the US Treasury This situation unfolds against a backdrop of increasing global attention to cryptocurrency regulation . Governments worldwide are grappling with how to manage and oversee the rapidly evolving digital asset space. The US Treasury plays a pivotal role in shaping financial regulations and policies in the United States. Its stance on cryptocurrency has significant implications for the industry\u2019s future, both domestically and internationally. The US Treasury\u2019s Influence on Crypto Regulation: Policy Setting: The Treasury Department is instrumental in formulating policies related to financial crimes, taxation, and economic sanctions, all of which directly impact the cryptocurrency sector. Enforcement: Agencies under the Treasury, like FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) and the IRS (Internal Revenue Service), are responsible for enforcing regulations related to cryptocurrency transactions and businesses. International Cooperation: The Treasury engages with international bodies to develop global standards for cryptocurrency regulation, influencing how other nations approach digital assets. Rep. Connolly\u2019s intervention underscores the need for any US Treasury initiative in the cryptocurrency space to be transparent, well-justified, and clearly in the public interest. It also emphasizes the ongoing tension between fostering innovation in the digital asset realm and mitigating potential risks, including financial crime and undue influence. Is a Strategic Crypto Reserve a Risky Bet for America? The question remains: is establishing a strategic crypto reserve a prudent or perilous path for the United States? Proponents might argue it\u2019s a forward-thinking move, positioning the U.S. at the forefront of digital finance and providing a new tool for economic and geopolitical strategy. However, critics, like Rep. Connolly, raise valid concerns about risks and potential downsides. Potential Risks of a Crypto Reserve: Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile. Holding a large reserve could expose the U.S. to significant financial risks if the market experiences a downturn. Security Concerns: Securing vast amounts of digital assets from hacking and theft is a considerable challenge. A strategic reserve would be a high-value target for cybercriminals. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency is still evolving. Unclear regulations could create legal and operational complexities for managing a crypto reserve . Ethical Considerations: As Connolly highlights, ethical concerns around conflicts of interest and the potential for misuse of public funds are paramount. Conclusion: Demanding Transparency and Public Interest Rep. Gerry Connolly \u2019s forceful opposition to the US Treasury \u2019s strategic crypto reserve plan throws a spotlight on the critical need for transparency, public consultation, and ethical considerations in government initiatives related to cryptocurrency. His concerns about potential Trump conflict of interest and the lack of congressional consultation are serious and warrant thorough investigation and public debate. As the U.S. navigates the complex world of digital assets, it\u2019s imperative that any strategic moves are demonstrably in the best interest of the American public, not just a select few. The future of cryptocurrency regulation and adoption in the U.S. hinges on decisions made with careful consideration, transparency, and a commitment to serving the broader public good. This situation serves as a stark reminder of the powerful intersection of politics, finance, and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency.

Frequently Asked Questions What is the price prediction of XRP in 2025? The current XRP price is $2.34, and based on the crypto market trends, analysts predict an XRP market range of $3-$5 in 2025. Growth depends on Ripple Network adoption, regulatory clarity, and market capitalization increases, as seen in the price chart history. How much will 1 XRP be worth in 2030? By 2030, XRP could reach $10-$20 if the Ripple Network gains mainstream adoption. The price chart suggests steady growth, but the XRP market depends on institutional use and overall crypto market expansion, influencing market capitalization. Can XRP reach $50? Unlikely in the near future. The XRP market needs massive demand, higher market capitalization, and widespread Ripple Network adoption. The current XRP price suggests steady growth, but the price chart doesn\u2019t support a $50 target unless drastic changes occur. Will XRP reach $20? It\u2019s possible but challenging. The crypto market must see major institutional adoption, and the Ripple Network needs expanded utility. The XRP market could push toward $20 long-term if demand spikes, as seen in historical price chart trends. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

It appears that this could all be part of a major strategy by President Trump to lower inflation, and thereby rates, and so be able to refinance $9 trillion of US debt. Can Bitcoin survive this and even rally to a new high? Trump prepared to let the stock market crash? President Trump has always been the champion of the U.S. stock market. In his previous term in office he would often point to climbing U.S. stocks and give his view that this was a clear sign of a strong and growing U.S. economy. It does now appear, at least for the short-term, that Trump has realised that a great way to bring inflation down would be to let the stock market crash. A falling stock market should certainly take the hot air out of the inflation balloon, deflating it enough that rates can come down, and the $9 trillion of debt maturing this year can be refinanced at much lower interest. Method in the madness It seems there could be method in the madness. From the very beginning of his presidency, Trump has talked about \u201cshort-term pain\u201d. He is probably thinking that Biden\u2019s previous \u201csoft landing\u201d strategy was just not going to work, and that a short, sharp, shock would achieve his ends far quicker. A recession looks to be very much on the cards. In on Trump\u2019s game plan, Elon Musk and DOGE are cutting government jobs massively, given that a large part of job creation has come within government over recent years, and a robust jobs figure has been a major factor in preventing a recession thus far. Where does this leave Bitcoin So where does this leave Bitcoin? History tells us that generally, Bitcoin will not rally when the stock market is falling, at least not for any extended period of time. That said, if Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent\u2019s remarks are anything to go by, that he is \u201cnot concerned about a little volatility over three weeks\u201d, the current crash may be just a very painful short-term event. With Bitcoin not far from retesting its hugely strong support base at $70,000, the rally could begin from there. $BTC inverse head and shoulders pattern? Source: TradingView The short-term chart for $BTC shows that the series of lower highs and lower lows are still being made EXCEPT for the most recent correction, where a higher low has just been printed. Interestingly, this last low may turn out to be the right shoulder of an inverse head and shoulders pattern. If the price does break out here, and this pattern plays out, the measured move would take the price back to the top trendline of the wedge. On the other hand, given the dismal state of the stock market, a rejection could certainly happen here. The price could then eventually go down to the major support band, from where a bottoming price action could occur. A huge rally could be coming Source: TradingView The weekly chart displays how the $BTC price is being drawn down to the major support band. However, candle wicks to the downside show how buyers are coming in to push the price back up. The support here is massively strong. This level acted as resistance for a good part of the last bull market, and it took 8 months of this bull market before the price was finally able to punch through. At the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index is foreshadowing a potential bounce. The indicator has come down to the very strong support level at 44.00, and should a bounce take place, this might be the first omen of a coming rally that could be tidal wave esque.

Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.\u2013Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President took the oath of office earlier this year, the administration has put in place efforts to reset the bilateral relations with Russia.

Russia\u2019s Oil Trade Revolution Powered by Crypto Assets According to a report by Reuters , Russia is using crypto assets in its oil trade with China and India to navigate the Western sanctions. According to close sources on the matter, some Russian oil companies are using Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and stablecoins to streamline the international forex trades of the Chinese Yuan, Indian Rupees, and Russian Roubles. The announcement follows a recent move by the U.S. DoJ to seize the Russian Garantex exchange , for allegedly enabling money laundering and violating sanctions. Earlier this week, police in the Indian state of Kerala arrested Aleksej Besciokov for his involvement in the Garantex exchange and soon will face the charges in the United States. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : U.S. Senate Banking Committee Advances Stablecoin Bill with Bipartisan Support; Full Senate Vote Next , Market Implication The use of crypto assets to facilitate the Russian oil trade business will have a profound effect on their market outlook. More countries that have been sanctioned by the United States and Western countries will follow in the same direction. Moreover, cryptocurrencies offer a seamless transfer of value 24/7 365 days a year compared to the rigid traditional banking sector. Consequently, the rising demand for Bitcoin and Ethereum will fuel the underlying macro-bullish outlook.

While meme coins are often known for their volatility, there\u2019s always a new opportunity to consider. Currently, three meme coins are catching the attention of investors: Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Brett, and Sudeng. Each brings something unique to the table, but Arctic Pablo Coin stands out with an enticing presale that\u2019s been heating up as it moves across locations. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins, focusing especially on Arctic Pablo Coin and its current presale phase. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Frozen Treasure Ready to Soar If you\u2019re hunting for the next big thing in meme coins, look no further than Arctic Pablo Coin (APC). With its innovative features and a meme coin presale price that\u2019s hard to ignore, Arctic Pablo Coin is shaping up to be one of the top new meme coins to buy for 2025. Investors have already raised over $1.87 million in the presale, which is no surprise given the token\u2019s impressive ROI potential. Currently priced at just $0.000074, APC is offering early investors a chance to see returns upwards of 10,694.59% by the time it lists at $0.008. And that\u2019s not all\u2014Arctic Pablo\u2019s token burn mechanism, combined with staking and rewards, ensures that the value keeps rising as the presale progresses. The unique presale structure is what makes APC even more appealing. Unlike typical presale stages, Arctic Pablo Coin is divided by locations, making each phase of its journey feel more like an exciting expedition. As the project makes its way from Frosty Falls to the next location, the price increases, and the number of available tokens decreases. This scarcity and increasing demand set the stage for even bigger price hikes. The token burn mechanism ensures that unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation every week, contributing to a deflationary environment and boosting scarcity. If you\u2019re still contemplating getting in, now is the time. As Arctic Pablo Coin reaches Frosty Falls (the 14th location of its journey), it\u2019s still priced at an incredibly low entry point of $0.000074. If you wait too long, the price will only go up, and the opportunity might slip away. As the presale progresses, the price will continue to rise with each new location, so those who act now are in for some major gains. Don\u2019t miss out on the chance to be part of this exciting journey, as Arctic Pablo Coin has already raised over $1.87 million and shows no sign of slowing down. Brett: The Rising Star of Meme Coins In the world of meme coins, Brett has been creating waves with its recent news. The latest update shows that Brett has made significant strides in developing its community and expanding its outreach. It\u2019s becoming evident that Brett has the potential to gain major traction in the market, particularly as more investors begin to take note of its growth. Sudeng: The Underdog of the Meme Coin Space While Sudeng may not be as talked about as Arctic Pablo Coin or Brett, its recent advancements have garnered attention in the crypto space. Sudeng\u2019s community engagement and unique approach to tokenomics have sparked discussions across forums and social media, making it one to watch. Whether or not Sudeng can capitalize on this momentum remains to be seen, but its continued development could make it a hidden gem in the meme coin market. Conclusion: Why Arctic Pablo Coin is the Meme Coin You Shouldn\u2019t Miss While Brett and Sudeng continue to grow and make their mark in the meme coin space, Arctic Pablo Coin is truly where the excitement is. With its innovative presale structure, strong ROI potential, and unique token burn mechanism, APC offers a compelling investment opportunity for 2025.

Meanwhile, a Texas federal judge issued a default judgment against Bancor DAO for failing to respond to a class-action lawsuit accusing it of misleading investors about liquidity issues and impermanent loss protection. Additionally, a Delaware court granted a temporary restraining order in a Bitcoin mining dispute, preventing Mawson Hosting from blocking access to 21,000 mining rigs amid a payment conflict with Consensus Colocation. Bankruptcy Court Sides With Three Arrows Capital A US bankruptcy court authorized the liquidators of the defunct crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) to increase their claim against the collapsed exchange FTX, raising it from $120 million to $1.53 billion. The ruling was issued by Chief Judge John Dorsey in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on March 13, and it dismissed arguments from FTX\u2019s debtors that the amended proof of claim from 3AC liquidators was untimely and aimed at delaying the bankruptcy proceedings. Dorsey found that 3AC liquidators gave sufficient notice of their claim and their intention to amend it after conducting a thorough review of all available data. He also attributed any delays in the filing process to FTX\u2019s failure to provide the relevant records in a timely manner. He mentioned\u00a0that the evidence indicated that the liquidators were very thorough in their information search, but FTX\u2019s debtors repeatedly withheld crucial data despite having it in their possession. Originally, 3AC liquidators filed a $120 million claim in June of 2023 as part of FTX\u2019s bankruptcy case. In November 2024, they expanded their claim due to allegations of breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and breach of fiduciary duty. According to the liquidators, FTX held $1.53 billion in hedge fund assets that were liquidated in 2022 to settle $1.33 billion in liabilities. They argued that these transactions were avoidable and caused harm to 3AC creditors while accusing FTX debtors of intentionally delaying the release of information that would have shed light on the liquidation. FTX\u2019s debtors objected to the revised claim, and argued that the original proof of claim lacked enough details to notify them about the true nature and extent of 3AC\u2019s allegations. They also held firm that the amendment came too late and should not be allowed. However, the court sided with 3AC by ruling that the amendment was justified given the circumstances. FTX filed for bankruptcy in November of 2022, and has been aggressively working to recover lost funds. In November 2024, the exchange launched multiple lawsuits, including one against SkyBridge Capital and its founder, Anthony Scaramucci, to reclaim funds that former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried allegedly misused for sponsorship and investment deals. Another legal battle targeted Binance and its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, seeking to recover $1.76 billion in cryptocurrency sent to Binance as part of a repurchase deal in July 2021. Texas Court Rules Against Bancor DAO 3AC is not the only company with its hands full legally. A Texas federal judge issued a default judgment against Bancor DAO after the decentralized finance platform failed to respond to an online summons. Judge Robert Pitman granted the judgment after Bancor DAO\u2019s absence in court after being summoned through a forum post in January of 2024. The ruling was confirmed on March 13 by district court clerk Philip Delvin, who stated that the defendant failed to answer or defend itself in the required timeframe. The class action lawsuit was filed in May of 2023, and it involves investors who claim they lost tens of millions of dollars due to Bancor\u2019s failure to warn them about liquidity issues during a surge in withdrawals in 2022. Plaintiffs argue that Bancor misled investors about its impermanent loss protection (ILP) mechanism for liquidity providers and that its token functioned as an unregistered security. They claim that Bancor\u2019s ILP was operating at a deficit, and in an attempt to cover its losses, the platform introduced a new product that promised high returns without exposing users to risk. Impermanent loss happens when liquidity providers in automated market maker models deposit assets into a pool, and the value of one token declines relative to the other. Bancor suspended its impermanent loss protection feature in June of 2022 due to adverse market conditions, which is a move that plaintiffs argue was not properly disclosed to investors. The lawsuit also contends that Bancor DAO functions as an \u201cunincorporated general partnership\u201d consisting of vBNT tokenholders, making it eligible to be sued as such. While the case was initially dismissed due to the protocol developers being located outside the United States, it was reopened in December. Plaintiffs pointed out that Bancor does not seem to be registered in any jurisdiction and lacks a physical office, mailing address, corporate officers, directors, or appointed agents. Bancor operates as an on-chain liquidity protocol that is designed for decentralized asset exchanges across multiple blockchains. According to DeFiLlama, the platform currently holds $38 million in total value locked, which is a 98% decline from its peak in May 2021. This ruling was made after legal precedent from a very similar case in which the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) won a default judgment against Ooki DAO . In another related case, a California federal judge ruled in November that DAOs and their governing members could be sued in instances involving unregistered securities. Bitcoin Mining Dispute Heats Up Meanwhile, a Delaware court granted a temporary restraining order in favor of Bitcoin miner Consensus Colocation and systems owner Stone Ridge Ventures, preventing hosting provider Mawson Hosting from blocking access to 21,000 mining rigs amid a payment dispute. Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn issued the order on March 12, barring Mawson from using the hashrate from the miners or restricting Consensus\u2019 access to the facility in Midland, Pennsylvania, until a preliminary injunction hearing. The dispute centers around alleged unpaid fees, contract terms, and Consensus\u2019 plan to relocate its mining equipment. Consensus claims that Mawson has been operating the rigs for its own gain since Feb. 28 while preventing Consensus personnel from accessing them. Mawson argues it has the right to use the rigs under its agreement with Consensus and claims unpaid fees and electricity prepayments justify redirecting the hashrate. In a March 6 legal complaint, Consensus accused Mawson of generating daily profits of $100,000 to $200,000 from mining Bitcoin using its $30 million worth of rigs while blocking both physical and digital access. Consensus and Stone Ridge initially signed a colocation agreement with Mawson in December of 2023, with plans to terminate the partnership by March of 2025 and gradually reduce capacity. Mawson argues that its contract allows for hashrate redirection under specific conditions, but Consensus\u2019 lawyers argue that when Mawson began mining on Feb. 28, the deposit was fully paid. They also allege that Mawson\u2019s actions far exceeded the $17,505.45 in late fees it claims Consensus owes. For now, the restraining order remains in place while the case moves forward.", "published_on": "2025-03-14T17:43:34", "url": "https://coinpaper.com/7989/us-court-allows-3-ac-to-rise-its-ftx-claim-to-1-53-billion", "source": "coinpaper", "categories": ["MINING", "REGULATION", "BTC", "BUSINESS", "EXCHANGE"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.047797533154676025, "subjectivity": 0.37199958771387337, "sentiment": "neutral"}, "entities": ["bitcoin"], "topics": ["claim", "court", "consensus", "bancor"]}, {"id": "41638251", "title": "Crypto Fear & Greed Index Plummets to 27: Decoding Worsening Crypto Market Sentiment", "body": "Are you feeling a chill in the crypto air? The latest readings from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index are flashing red, indicating a significant shift in crypto sentiment . The index, a key barometer of market emotions, has taken a sharp downturn, signaling increased fear among investors. Let\u2019s dive into what this means for you and the broader crypto market . What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does It Matter? The Fear and Greed Index , a creation of Alternative.me, isn\u2019t just another number; it\u2019s a powerful tool designed to gauge the overall mood of the cryptocurrency market. Think of it as a sentiment thermometer for crypto. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100. When the index leans towards 0, it screams \u2018Extreme Fear\u2019 \u2013 suggesting investors are overly worried, which, paradoxically, can sometimes present buying opportunities. Conversely, when it surges towards 100, it signals \u2018Extreme Greed,\u2019 hinting at a market that might be overheating and due for a correction. Why is this index so crucial? Because market psychology plays a massive role in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Understanding whether the market is driven by fear or greed can provide valuable insights for traders and investors looking to make informed decisions. It\u2019s about sensing the pulse of the market to navigate the choppy waters of crypto trading more effectively. Breaking Down the Factors: What Drives the Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn\u2019t based on guesswork. It\u2019s calculated using a blend of six key market indicators, each weighted to reflect its influence on overall market sentiment: Volatility (25%): Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the average values over the last 30 and 90 days. Unusually high volatility can signal fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares current market momentum and volume against the past 30 and 90-day averages. High buying volumes often indicate greed, while low volumes can suggest fear. Social Media (15%): Analyzes sentiment on social media platforms, primarily Twitter, for crypto-related hashtags. A higher volume of negative posts can contribute to a fear reading. Surveys (15%): Conducts weekly crypto polls to gauge investor sentiment directly. (Note: This method is currently paused). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Tracks Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in the overall crypto market. Increased Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate a flight to safety during fearful times. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries. Surges in searches like \u201cBitcoin crash\u201d can indicate fear, while searches for \u201cbuy Bitcoin\u201d might suggest greed. These factors are meticulously combined to provide a holistic view of the prevailing crypto sentiment . The Plunge to 27: What Does \u2018Fear\u2019 Really Mean for the Crypto Market? As of March 14th, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index stands at 27. This isn\u2019t just a minor dip; it\u2019s a significant seven-point drop from the previous day and a substantial 18-point fall from the reading before that. Crucially, this reading firmly plants the index back in the \u2018Fear\u2019 zone. But what does a reading of 27 truly signify for the crypto market ? A \u2018Fear\u2019 reading suggests that investors are becoming increasingly anxious and risk-averse. This could be triggered by a variety of factors such as: Price Corrections: Sharp drops in cryptocurrency prices are a primary driver of fear. Seeing portfolio values decline rapidly can induce panic selling and heightened anxiety. Market Uncertainty: External economic factors, regulatory news, or geopolitical events can create uncertainty, leading investors to become more cautious and fearful. Negative News Cycles: A barrage of negative news headlines \u2013 be it exchange hacks, regulatory crackdowns, or project failures \u2013 can dampen market sentiment and push the index into the \u2018Fear\u2019 zone. When the index is in \u2018Fear,\u2019 it often reflects a market characterized by increased volatility and potential downward pressure on prices. However, seasoned investors also recognize that periods of extreme fear can sometimes present unique buying opportunities. As the adage goes, \u201cBe fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.\u201d The Fear and Greed Index helps to quantify these market emotions. Navigating Fear: How to Use the Fear & Greed Index in Your Crypto Strategy So, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is flashing \u2018Fear\u2019 \u2013 now what? This isn\u2019t a crystal ball, but it\u2019s a valuable tool to integrate into your crypto investment strategy. Here\u2019s how you can use it to potentially enhance your decision-making: Actionable Insights: Identify Potential Buying Opportunities: Extreme fear (index values below 25) can signal that the market might be oversold. This doesn\u2019t guarantee an immediate price reversal, but it suggests that assets could be undervalued, presenting a potential entry point for long-term investors. Exercise Caution During Greed: Extreme greed (index values above 75) can be a warning sign of a market bubble. It might be prudent to take profits, reduce exposure, or avoid excessive risk-taking when the market is euphoric. Confirm Market Trends: Use the index in conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis tools. A \u2018Fear\u2019 reading during a downtrend can reinforce the bearish outlook, while a \u2018Greed\u2019 reading during an uptrend can strengthen the bullish case. Manage Portfolio Risk: Adjust your portfolio risk based on the prevailing market sentiment. During periods of fear, you might consider hedging strategies or reducing your overall exposure to volatile assets. Example Scenario: Let\u2019s say the Fear and Greed Index is consistently in the \u2018Extreme Fear\u2019 zone (below 20) while you believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin. This could be an opportune moment to dollar-cost average into Bitcoin, buying incrementally over time as prices are potentially suppressed by fear-driven selling. Conversely, if the index is in \u2018Extreme Greed\u2019 (above 80) and you\u2019ve seen significant gains in your altcoin portfolio, it might be wise to rebalance and take some profits off the table. Challenges and Caveats: Interpreting the Crypto Fear & Greed Index with Caution While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a useful sentiment indicator, it\u2019s crucial to understand its limitations and use it judiciously. It\u2019s not a standalone predictor of market movements, and relying solely on it can be misleading. Here are some key considerations: Lagging Indicator: The index reflects past and present market sentiment. It may not always accurately predict future price movements. Sentiment can shift rapidly, and the index might lag behind sudden market changes. External Factors: The index primarily focuses on crypto-specific data. External macroeconomic events, regulatory announcements, or black swan events can significantly impact the crypto market regardless of the Fear & Greed Index reading. Not a Trading Signal: The index should not be treated as a direct buy or sell signal. It\u2019s a sentiment gauge, not a precise trading tool. Always combine it with your own research, risk assessment, and trading strategy. Subjectivity in Interpretation: While the index provides a numerical value, interpreting what constitutes \u2018fear\u2019 or \u2018greed\u2019 is still somewhat subjective and can vary among investors. Therefore, approach the Fear and Greed Index as one piece of the puzzle in your crypto analysis toolkit. Use it to supplement your understanding of market sentiment , but always conduct thorough research and consider a wide range of factors before making investment decisions. Conclusion: Staying Informed in a Fearful Market The Crypto Fear & Greed Index \u2018s recent plunge to 27 serves as a stark reminder of the inherent volatility and emotional swings within the cryptocurrency market. While the \u2018Fear\u2019 zone might seem unsettling, understanding and interpreting this sentiment is crucial for navigating the crypto landscape effectively. By incorporating the index into your analysis, alongside other indicators and sound risk management practices, you can make more informed decisions and potentially capitalize on market opportunities, even amidst fear.

While the correction was slow and draining to the industry, investors speculate a strong, perhaps even sudden, surge that may propel prices to their earlier higher range. In this scenario, some altcoins are likely to go up alongside Bitcoin. These are most likely to be leading altcoins, alongside those that have been trending. Here are the top 6 most popular projects to consider for major gains as the market recovers again back to its original price ranges. Best Crypto to Buy Now BTC Bull As Bitcoin inches toward the $100k mark, BTC Bull has been capturing attention for its strong ties to the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency. Unlike speculative projects with no clear direction, BTC Bull embraces Bitcoin\u2019s growth, rewarding its holders with airdrops whenever key milestones are achieved. This makes it not just a token to hold but one that actively benefits investors during bullish market movements. The presale is seeing heavy demand, with the token inching closer to selling out. As previous trends have shown, projects that gain traction before launch often experience significant price jumps once they hit the open market. Those waiting for Bitcoin\u2019s breakout may find BTC Bull to be a timely addition, as its growth potential is directly influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s increasing dominance. Adding to its appeal is its branding, which features a powerful bull mascot draped in Bitcoin imagery. This visual representation reinforces its commitment to the Bitcoin ecosystem, positioning it as a meme coin with a clear and relevant narrative. With market conditions improving, BTC Bull\u2019s ability to tap into Bitcoin\u2019s momentum could make it a major gainer in the short to mid-term. As social media buzz continues to grow, it\u2019s becoming increasingly evident that many traders see BTC Bull as a top pick ahead of the next big market surge. MIND of Pepe MIND of Pepe isn\u2019t just another meme-driven crypto\u2014it takes the concept a step further by integrating AI, allowing it to function as an active market participant rather than a passive asset. The project has been making waves due to its AI-driven nature, which enables it to interact with social media trends, analyze market sentiment, and even generate its own opinions. AI remains one of the strongest narratives in the crypto space, and when combined with the ever-growing appeal of meme coins, it creates a powerful fusion that could lead to rapid growth. If investor enthusiasm for AI-related tokens continues, MIND of Pepe could see heightened interest and, subsequently, stronger price action as it gains traction. Beyond its concept, the project has also been seeing strong community support, which is a crucial factor for any meme coin\u2019s success. Social media engagement plays a significant role in determining whether a project can sustain momentum, and MIND of Pepe\u2019s AI-driven mechanics give it an edge in maintaining relevance. The project has raised over $7 million too, which is another reason why it could be a good idea to invest in the project\u2014trend-based demand. As the market recovers, assets that align with popular narratives tend to gain the most traction. Given its dual appeal to AI and meme investors, MIND of Pepe could be positioned for a strong surge if the current demand persists and listings bring in additional volume. Solana Solana has firmly established itself as one of the top-performing blockchains, offering high-speed transactions and significantly lower fees compared to many competitors. Despite market fluctuations, it has continued to attract developers, users, and projects, solidifying its role as a major player in the industry. During previous bull runs, Solana has been one of the strongest-performing altcoins, and its ability to sustain momentum even in bearish conditions suggests that it could be primed for another surge. With institutional interest rising and the blockchain ecosystem expanding, Solana\u2019s current price levels may represent a strong accumulation zone for those anticipating its next breakout. Another key factor driving Solana\u2019s growth is its increasing adoption in DeFi, NFTs, and other decentralized applications. As the market turns bullish, projects built on Solana tend to benefit from increased activity, leading to greater demand for SOL itself. At about $125 per token , SOL could definitely be considered to be at an excellent price point right now. With Bitcoin stabilizing and setting the stage for another rally, Solana remains one of the most closely watched altcoins. Historically, it has been a top choice for traders looking for high returns, and if the market sees a strong rebound, SOL could once again emerge as one of the biggest winners. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token has been making waves as one of the most sought-after utility-based crypto presales. As part of the Best Wallet ecosystem, it plays a critical role in facilitating transactions, staking, and exclusive user benefits within the platform. With demand surging, the presale is nearing a significant fundraising milestone, indicating strong investor confidence in its long-term potential. What makes Best Wallet particularly interesting right now is its positioning within a rapidly growing sector. With more investors looking for secure and efficient ways to manage their assets across multiple chains, Best Wallet\u2019s multi-chain compatibility gives it an edge. Unlike many wallets that focus on a single ecosystem, Best Wallet supports over 60 blockchains, offering seamless integration for users navigating DeFi, trading, and portfolio management. Beyond its core functionality, the token itself is expected to play a key role in the ecosystem, offering transaction discounts, staking rewards, and exclusive access to new features. The presale has already demonstrated strong momentum, and once the token launches, its utility-driven demand could further drive price appreciation. As the broader market gears up for another bullish phase, Best Wallet Token could be one of the most stable yet high-reward options for those seeking a long-term hold with tangible benefits within an expanding crypto infrastructure. Meme Index Meme coins have gone from being a niche trend to a legitimate asset class, with many outperforming traditional cryptocurrencies. However, investing in them can often feel like navigating a minefield. Meme Index simplifies this by offering a structured way to gain exposure to meme coins through a risk-based indexing system. The project features four distinct indexes, allowing investors to choose their level of exposure based on risk appetite. This eliminates the need for extensive research while still offering a way to participate in the booming meme coin market. As mainstream adoption of crypto expands, the idea of structured investing in meme coins is gaining traction, making Meme Index a forward-thinking approach to what has traditionally been a highly volatile space. The project has already raised over $4 million, further proving that investors see value in this concept. Additionally, influential crypto YouTuber Austin Hilton has discussed the project in his videos, adding further credibility to its potential. With the broader market recovering, meme coins tend to see exaggerated price movements, making Meme Index a particularly interesting option. For those looking to gain exposure to meme coins without having to pick individual tokens, this project could be a strong mid-term play with significant upside potential. Cardano Cardano has long been a favorite among long-term investors due to its strong development focus and methodical approach to blockchain innovation. While its growth has been more gradual compared to other major altcoins, its consistent network upgrades and increasing adoption have positioned it as a solid choice for those looking beyond short-term hype. One of Cardano\u2019s key strengths lies in its research-driven development model. Unlike many blockchains that rush into trends, Cardano implements upgrades only after thorough peer review and testing, ensuring long-term sustainability. This has made it a reliable option, particularly for investors looking for a more stable alternative in the often volatile crypto market. As the market recovers, large-cap altcoins with strong ecosystems are likely to see renewed interest. Cardano\u2019s ecosystem has continued expanding, with more dApps, DeFi protocols, and real-world partnerships coming to the network. With its staking model offering attractive yields and the blockchain becoming more efficient, ADA could see increased demand in the coming months, potentially soaring above the $0.7 range that it currently is in. For those looking for an asset that balances growth potential with a more structured development approach, Cardano remains a viable choice. If the market sees a broader rally, ADA\u2019s historical performance suggests that it could be well-positioned to benefit from renewed investor interest. Conclusion A well-balanced crypto portfolio isn\u2019t just about picking random tokens\u2014it requires identifying projects that are either trending, in their early stages, or sitting at attractive price levels. At the same time, factors like real-world utility and strong market appeal play a crucial role in determining long-term success. The projects highlighted above check these boxes, making them strong candidates for those looking to capitalize on the next wave of market growth. Trending tokens often gain traction quickly, while early-stage projects present opportunities to get in before major price jumps. Meanwhile, assets at key price points with strong fundamentals can provide a more stable yet high-upside investment. The key is to strike a balance between speculation and tangible value, ensuring that each asset held has a solid case for potential growth. While no investment comes without risk, carefully selecting cryptos that align with market sentiment and industry trends can lead to significant rewards. By staying informed and making calculated decisions, investors can position themselves for gains as the market continues its upward trajectory.

Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Hyland noted that BTC\u2019s weekly resistance level currently hovers around the $90,500 level. The analyst emphasized that if BTC has a weekly close above $89,000, then it may indicate that the market bottom is in. He added: If we do get a weekly close above this area ($89,000 to $91,000), I think the low is in for Bitcoin, and we are not going down to this area. To recall, BTC last traded above $89,000 earlier this month on March 9. From there, the cryptocurrency experienced a breakdown to lower price levels, primarily due to rising macroeconomic uncertainties due to US President Donald Trump\u2019s trade tariffs on numerous countries. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slips Under 200-Day Moving Average \u2013 Will The Downtrend Continue? According to data from cryptocurrency exchange Binance, after failing to defend the $89,000 level, BTC ended up falling as low as $76,606 on March 10. Since then, the digital asset has made slight recovery, buoyed by lower than anticipated US CPI inflation data and is currently trading in the low $80,000 level. BTC Faces Strong Resistance At $86,100 Similarly, in a recent Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, analyst Yonsei_dent highlighted the significance of short-term holder (STH) Realized Price in determining the digital asset\u2019s future price trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Uptrend Soon? Dollar Index Breakdown Sparks Optimism Among BTC Bulls For the uninitiated, Bitcoin\u2019s Realized Price refers to the average acquisition cost of investors while STH refers to holders who have held BTC for less than six months. These investors are typically more sensitive to market movements. The analyst remarked that the weighted average Realized Price for STHs who have held BTC for one week to six months lies around $91,800, suggesting that these investors are currently in a loss position. The three months to six months STH cohort has a Realized Price of $86,100, denoting a strong resistance level for the digital asset in the short-term. Notably, this group of holders has the highest share of Realized Cap among STHs, hinting that selling pressure could magnify around this price level. With regard to major support levels, long-term holders (LTH) with a holding time of six months to twelve months have a Realized Price of $63,700. The post adds: The highest volume profile over the past year is concentrated around $64,000. This reinforces the idea that this area could serve as a strong support level. If BTC fails to clear some of its immediate resistance levels, there is a high possibility that it may follow Arthur Hayes prediction of finding a bottom around $70,000. That said, several indicators suggest that BTC may be undervalued at its current market price. At press time, BTC trades at $81,745, up 0.7% in the past 24 hours.

Let\u2019s dive into what this means for the future of crypto investment and why this is a significant indicator of investor confidence in Bitcoin ETFs. Decoding the Bitcoin ETF Inflow Trend According to Bloomberg Intelligence, the cumulative spot Bitcoin ETF inflows experienced a decrease, dropping from $40.25 billion on February 7th to $34.9 billion as of March 11th. This data, highlighted by Eric Balchunas, a Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, initially sparked concerns about waning interest in these investment vehicles. But is this dip in ETF inflows a cause for alarm? Not necessarily. It\u2019s crucial to look beyond just the inflow numbers and examine the bigger picture. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of the inflow situation: Peak Inflow (Feb 7): $40.25 billion Recent Inflow (Mar 11): $34.9 billion Decrease: $5.35 billion While a $5.35 billion decrease might sound substantial, it\u2019s important to consider the context of the overall market and the total assets under management (AUM) of these ETFs. The Astonishing Resilience: 95% Capital Retention Here\u2019s where the truly compelling narrative emerges. Despite the reduced ETF inflows , the total AUM for spot Bitcoin ETFs remains robust at $115 billion. This figure underscores a crucial point: over 95% of the capital invested in these Bitcoin ETFs has stayed put. This high retention rate speaks volumes about investor sentiment and the long-term conviction in Bitcoin ETF products. Think about it \u2013 in the often-turbulent crypto market, where assets can be quickly moved based on short-term price fluctuations, the steadfastness of capital within Bitcoin ETFs is remarkable. It suggests that investors are not simply chasing short-term gains but are adopting a more strategic, long-term approach to crypto investment through ETFs. Why is Capital Retention a Big Deal for Bitcoin ETFs? This high retention rate is not just a number; it\u2019s a powerful indicator with several positive implications: Strong Investor Confidence: Maintaining 95% of invested capital suggests a high level of confidence among investors in Bitcoin ETFs as a viable investment avenue. They are choosing to hold their positions, even amidst fluctuating inflows, indicating belief in the long-term potential of Bitcoin. Long-Term Investment Strategy: The data points towards a shift from short-term speculation to long-term holding within the crypto ETF space. Investors are likely viewing Bitcoin ETFs as a strategic part of their portfolio, rather than a quick-profit scheme. Market Maturity: This stability can be seen as a sign of maturing crypto markets. The focus is shifting towards sustainable growth and long-term value accumulation, rather than being solely driven by hype and rapid trading. Reduced Volatility Impact: High capital retention can potentially buffer Bitcoin ETFs against extreme volatility. A stable AUM provides a cushion against market downturns and reinforces the ETF\u2019s position as a reliable investment product. The Role of Institutional Investment in Bitcoin ETFs While retail investors play a significant role, the steady capital within Bitcoin ETFs also hints at the growing influence of institutional investment . Institutions typically have a longer investment horizon and conduct thorough due diligence before allocating capital. Their participation in Bitcoin ETFs would naturally contribute to higher retention rates and greater market stability. Here\u2019s why institutional involvement is crucial: Factor Impact of Institutional Investment Investment Horizon Longer-term perspective, reducing knee-jerk reactions to market fluctuations. Due Diligence Thorough research and analysis, leading to more informed and stable investment decisions. Capital Size Larger capital deployments, contributing to significant and sustained AUM. Market Credibility Increased legitimacy and acceptance of Bitcoin as an asset class. As institutional investment in crypto continues to grow, we can expect this trend of strong capital retention in Bitcoin ETFs to persist and even strengthen. Bitcoin Price and ETF Performance: A Symbiotic Relationship? The performance of Bitcoin ETFs is intrinsically linked to the Bitcoin price . While ETF inflows and outflows can influence short-term price movements, the fundamental value driver remains Bitcoin itself. The fact that Bitcoin ETFs are retaining capital despite inflow dips could be interpreted as a bullish signal for the underlying asset. A strong AUM in Bitcoin ETFs can potentially: Support Bitcoin Price: Consistent demand through ETFs can provide buying pressure, supporting the Bitcoin price, especially during market corrections. Attract Further Investment: Stable and growing ETFs can attract more investors, both retail and institutional, further fueling the ecosystem. Enhance Market Liquidity: Active Bitcoin ETFs contribute to market liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell Bitcoin. However, it\u2019s important to remember that the Bitcoin price is also influenced by a multitude of other factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and overall market sentiment. Navigating the Future of Crypto Investment with Bitcoin ETFs The resilience demonstrated by Bitcoin ETFs in retaining 95% of capital, even with fluctuating inflows, paints an encouraging picture for the future of crypto investment . It highlights a maturing market where long-term conviction and strategic allocation are gaining prominence over short-term speculation. For investors, this signifies a potential shift towards more stable and reliable crypto investment vehicles. Key Takeaways for Investors: Long-Term Perspective: Consider Bitcoin ETFs as a long-term investment, rather than a get-rich-quick scheme. Diversification: Bitcoin ETFs can be a valuable tool for portfolio diversification within the crypto space. Due Diligence: Understand the nuances of Bitcoin ETFs, including fees, tracking error, and the underlying Bitcoin market. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market trends, regulatory updates, and developments in the crypto ETF space. In conclusion, the story of Bitcoin ETFs retaining the vast majority of their capital amidst inflow variations is a testament to the enduring appeal of Bitcoin and the growing sophistication of the crypto investment landscape. It\u2019s a powerful sign of investor confidence and a beacon for the continued evolution of crypto as a mainstream asset class.

The token trades near $0.7250 after a 11% day-to-day recovery but suffers a 40% loss from its March peaks following its entry to the U.S. strategic reserve which shows no future expansion plans. A major loss of confidence has occurred because co-founder Charles Hoskinson has stayed away from important policy discussions which has exposed ADA to continuous selling pressure. Financial analysts predict a probable 50 percent market decline in ADA price to reach $0.27 when macroeconomic stress intensifies which would extend bearish conditions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) leverages market sentiment shifts to attract Cardano holders who are drawn into quick-selling phases by its established profit plans and practical DeFi functionalities. Cardano\u2019s Rocky Path Various investor disputes alongside external market threats become the main causes behind Cardano\u2019s current difficulties. The token experiences short-lived relief before encountering resistance at its 200-day moving average which has already been tested on three occasions within one month. Political projects falling short and dormant reserve spending increased investor concern which made them search for options showing more appealing growth perspectives. ADS faces increased possibilities of price declines due to widespread market volatility that combines recessionary jitters with rising caution levels among traders. The chart indicators suggest ADA could break down from its $0.55 February support level which may trigger a price drop of 50% into future market zones during late-2024. Mutuum Finance shows an upward trend in its business operations while ADA holders choose to pivot to this platform due to their discontent with ADA\u2019s present standing. Mutuum Finance\u2019s Strategic Ascent Mutuum Finance (MUTM) currently sells through its third presale period at $0.02. It has attracted investment from 5,500 participants totaling $3.2 million. The upcoming Phase 4 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will rapidly progress toward a price increase to $0.025 while investors actively predict this advancement. People who invest in Mutuum Finance during early phases can expect a 200% ROI as the token reaches its $0.06 exchange listing while the tokenomics follow open guidelines instead of market-driven speculation. Numerous analysts expect Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to rise from its current $0.02 to $3.50 by 2025 based on new projections that account for user adoption and stake buy-back initiatives. This constitutes a predicted 17,400% increase from the launch price. The operational features of decentralized lending pools and overcollateralized loans together with mtTokens enabling value growth through interest redistribution create the forecasting basis. The stability mechanism of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) arises from its systemic purchase mechanism. Networking fees on the platform automatically obtain MUTM tokens that distribute to stakers and liquidity providers continuously. The system creates a mechanism that prevents selling of tokens along with benefits structured for long-term owner maintenance. The mtTokens system allows users to earn yields directly from their holdings across multiple platforms which attracts investors who want to maximize their yield. Users who enter late into Phase 3 will likely face higher costs when exchanges begin trading because of concentrating supply during the Phase. Timing the Shift Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a shielded opportunity for investors who wish to preserve their capital within operating DeFi systems when Cardano faces external dangers. Through its staged presale approach the project generates progressive capital enhancement which will continue to grow after its market release. Investors who need to restructure their portfolios because of ADA instability can find a quantifiable risk buffer through MUTM. Investors should buy positions in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 3 because prices will rise and opportunities will decrease. The chances to maximize presale benefits decrease speedily so potential buyers should join now to secure profitable investments before its launch on the market.

At the Group of Seven (G7) meeting in Canada, European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the real winner of the ongoing tariff war is China. \u201cWho is laughing on the side or looking at the side is China,\u201d Kallas said in an interview. Her statement came after US President Donald Trump threatened 200% tariffs on French and European wines, champagne, and other alcohol imports. The move was retaliation for the EU\u2019s plan to impose taxes on American whiskey exports, which itself was a response to Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum. Kallas said the EU is prepared to fight back but wants to avoid economic fallout. \u201cWe keep a cool head, and of course, we are ready to act and defend our interest when we need to,\u201d she said . The impact was immediate. European alcohol stocks plummeted. LVMH, the parent company of Mo\u00ebt & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot, fell 2.2%, R\u00e9my Cointreau SA lost 4.5%, and Pernod Ricard dropped 3.6%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 entered a correction, hitting its lowest level in six months as investors reacted to another inflation report and Trump\u2019s latest tariff threats. Trump\u2019s trade wars are pushing allies away Trump\u2019s aggressive trade policies have put traditional US allies on edge. The European Union is now negotiating new trade deals with other partners, moving away from its reliance on the US. Former US diplomat Wendy Cutler said the EU has already taken major steps toward diversifying trade. \u201cThe EU had concluded a big deal with the Mercosur countries. The EU and India are going to restart their negotiations,\u201d she said. Mercosur, a trade bloc of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, signed a landmark trade deal with the EU in December. The agreement eliminates tariffs on over 90% of trade, giving European companies a \u20ac4 billion annual boost. It also means South American goods will have better access to European markets than US or Japanese products. China is taking full advantage of the US-EU tensions. David Roche, strategist at Quantum Strategy, said Europe has no choice but to explore alternatives. \u201cThe reality is, in the broadest sense of the word, Europe has to look for alternative markets to the US. China can help,\u201d Roche said. China strengthens its global trade position China has been expanding trade partnerships while the US continues to isolate itself. It recently upgraded its free trade agreement with ASEAN, securing stronger economic ties in the region. Cutler pointed out that China is actively offering economic stability to US trade partners. \u201cIf our partners can\u2019t rely on us, guess what? These other countries, including China, look more attractive,\u201d she said. At the same time, the US is absent from key global trade agreements. The US is not part of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) or the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Hong Kong has applied to join RCEP, and the UK recently joined CPTPP, further shifting global trade away from American influence. With Europe looking to diversify its trade, there\u2019s even speculation that the EU might consider joining CPTPP. Cutler believes this is a real possibility. \u201cI expect other countries to express interest \u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the question that perhaps the EU even thinks about joining CPTPP. It\u2019s a new world out there,\u201d she said. Trump\u2019s chaos strategy leaves allies frustrated Trump\u2019s approach to trade policy has been unpredictable. Stephen Olson, senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, said Trump deliberately keeps trade partners off balance. \u201cTrump thinks that he thrives under situations of chaos. So when everyone else in the world is running around with their hair set on fire, Trump thinks that works to his advantage,\u201d Olson said. For US allies, this makes long-term trade agreements impossible. Olson dismissed the idea that Trump\u2019s trade war has a clear strategy. \u201cMy advice would be \u2026 don\u2019t bother,\u201d he said, adding that Trump is not interested in \u201csolid, concrete resolutions\u201d. Instead, his goal is to keep trade partners under pressure, never letting them feel secure in negotiations. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The Dabba Network will operate as a DePIN marketplace, coordinating multiple supply-side stakeholders to deliver high-speed internet access based on consumer demand.\nDabba Network aggregates services from India\u2019s independent backhaul providers and local cable operators. By compensating them with Dabba Tokens (DBT), this model incentivizes participation, strengthens the competitiveness of small, independent providers, and expands Dabba Network\u2019s scalability.\nDabba Network adopts a demand-led model, installing hotspots where there is confirmed consumer demand from paying subscribers. This approach optimizes resource allocation to align infrastructure deployment with usage needs and reduce inefficiencies common in supply-first strategies.\nDabba Network serves as a \u201cLayer 0 DePIN\u201d that establishes the foundational infrastructure required for other DePINs to operate. By bridging connectivity gaps in India, Dabba enables other projects to expand their footprint in the country, effectively increasing their total addressable market.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIndia\u2019s rapid development has made it the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy, yet connectivity remains a major bottleneck to future growth\u2014with nearly half of the population still offline. At the same time, data consumption per subscriber has doubled since 2019, making India home to some of the highest mobile data usage levels globally.\n\nDespite this surging demand, major telecom providers continue to face mounting debt burdens and a lack of economic incentives to expand into lower-density, less-profitable regions. As a result, digital infrastructure has become highly concentrated in developed urban centers, widening the digital divide and limiting opportunities for millions in rural and underserved urban communities.\n\nTo bypass the capital-intensive model of traditional internet service providers, Dabba introduces a DePIN solution that coordinates local and global stakeholders to deploy a decentralized WiFi network capable of meeting India\u2019s connectivity demands. By integrating WiFi hotspots with a blockchain-powered token system, Dabba lowers setup costs through global crowdsourcing and sustains network expansion by incentivizing contributors. This model aims to not only meet the growing demand for high-speed internet in major cities but also drive infrastructure development in underserved areas to help close India\u2019s digital divide.\n\nBackground\n\nDabba Network began in 2016 as an experiment by entrepreneurs Karam Lakshman and Shubhendu Sharma. Frustrated by poor connectivity at their favorite tea shop in Bengaluru, India, they set up a Raspberry Pi-powered hotspot at the location. The unsecured network quickly attracted locals, turning the shop into a community WiFi hub. Recognizing this demand, they founded WiFi Dabba Inc. (Dabba) and began deploying routers across the city.\n\nThroughout the following years, the company scaled its operations across India by deploying hundreds of hotspots in key areas. To fuel further growth, the team started exploring new funding models and pivoted to a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) model.\n\nIn November 2023, the transition began with the launch of Dabba Lite hotspot. With this release, global investors can purchase the hotspots and lease them to local network operators, who then deploy them in underserved regions. In return, owners will soon be able to earn DBT token rewards based on data consumption. During the initial rollout, over 1,000 hotspots were reserved globally for deployment in India. By May 2024, a second expansion phase introduced 10,000 additional hotspots for purchase, which have all sold out as of Q1 2025.\n\nDabba Network currently operates with over 4,500 deployed hotspots serving over 77,000 connected devices. The network handles 50 TB to 60 TB of data transfer per day, with an average daily data transfer of 13 GB per hotspot. Instead of deploying hotspots and then attracting users, Dabba benefits from a demand-driven model where hotspots are only deployed in areas with existing consumer demand. Demand is established in two ways: individuals can request broadband service from LCOs to receive a Dabba Lite hotspot, or LCOs can deploy hotspots to expand service for their existing customers. This approach aims to optimize resource allocation and ensure efficient network expansion.\n\nAs of writing, Dabba has raised over $5 million from Y Combinator, Multicoin Capital, Borderless Ventures, Generation Ventures, and private angel investors.\n\nTechnology and Products\n\nDabba Network Stakeholders\n\nDecentralized Wireless (<a href=\"https://messari.io/\">DeWi</a>) networks provide an alternative approach to building and operating internet infrastructure. Unlike traditional Internet Service Providers, which require significant capital and operational expenditures, DeWi networks can crowdsource these costs from local and global stakeholders, who are then rewarded with tokens in exchange for their participation. The Dabba Network applies the DeWi model by functioning as a telecom aggregator that coordinates various stakeholders to provide internet access to data consumers.\n\nThe novelty in Dabba\u2019s approach lies in its ability to leverage the capabilities of small, existing companies that might otherwise struggle to compete with major telecom providers. India currently has over 150,000 Local Cable Operators (LCOs), many of whom can provide the necessary infrastructure and expertise to expand internet access but lack the financial resources to scale effectively. Meanwhile, backhaul providers can offer high-speed connectivity from existing fiber optic networks, but often struggle to reach end users in homes, businesses, and remote areas. By integrating these stakeholders into a decentralized marketplace where end users pay to access their services, Dabba can benefit from more cost-efficient network expansion while empowering local businesses.\n\nThe primary stakeholders in Dabba Network include:\n\nHotspot Owners: buy and lease Dabba Lite hotspots, activating them with Dabba tokens and earning rewards based on data usage.\nHardware Manufacturers: develop and supply network hardware for deployment, including Dabba Lite, Dabba Pro, and Dabba Laser.\nLocal Cable Operators (LCOs): provide last-mile broadband connectivity and maintain network infrastructure within their service area.\nBackhaul Providers: supply internet bandwidth, aggregate demand to reduce costs, and receive token incentives for infrastructure upgrades.\nLocation Owners: host Dabba hotspots in homes, businesses, and remote areas, enabling consumers to access WiFi.\nData Consumers:  access broadband services and can earn token-based incentives through network participation.\n\nDabba Lite Hotspot\n\nDabba Network uses Dabba Lite hotspots, which are WiFi 6 routers powered by a custom operating system optimized for security and network compatibility. Designed for indoor deployment in residential and small-scale commercial spaces, these devices extend network coverage and provide public internet access in designated areas. Additionally, hotspots can earn multiple token rewards simultaneously by supporting VPN relaying, ad-blocking, and other bandwidth-utilizing tasks that require minimal to moderate computational resources.\n\nDabba Lite hotspots operate on dual-band Wi-Fi (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz), ensuring low latency and increased network capacity. Wi-Fi 6 technology enhances data speeds and bandwidth efficiency to support video streaming, web browsing, VoIP calls, and other data-intensive applications while maintaining performance across multiple simultaneous connections. The device also incorporates security protocols to protect user data and ensure reliable public Wi-Fi access.\n\nOnboarding Process\n\nOnce DBT launches, hotspot owners will be able to spend $100 worth of DBT tokens to begin earning DBT rewards. The onboarding process will be as follows:\n\nThe hotspot owner will begin by completing KYC verification through the Dabba Explorer Platform. They will then register the device by burning $10 worth of DBT to prove ownership. This action will generate a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) that links the hotspot to the owner\u2019s wallet, ensuring that all future DBT rewards earned by the device are allocated to the owner.  \nAfter registration, the hotspot owner will select a Local Cable Operator (LCO) from the available providers to install the device at a designated location. The owner will then enter into a seven-year lease agreement, facilitated through the Dabba Network, by paying $70 worth of DBT to cover commissioning costs.\nOnce the device is installed, the LCO will burn $10 worth of DBT to verify deployment before activation. To activate the device, the hotspot owner will then preload the device with $10 worth of DBT to cover the first month of backhaul connectivity.\nTo promote the hotspot\u2019s availability and encourage user adoption, the owner will select a marketing provider and allocate $10 worth of DBT toward advertising efforts aimed at attracting end users.\n\nLayer Zero DePIN\n\nDabba Network serves as a \u201cLayer Zero DePIN\u201d that provides the foundational physical infrastructure required by other DePINs to operate and scale. To define the different roles within the DePIN ecosystem, Dabba categorizes DePIN layers as follows:\n\nLayer 0 DePINs: new infrastructure for internet connectivity and data transmission that creates the foundation for other projects to build upon.\nLayer 1 DePINs: hardware plugins that enhance and optimize existing infrastructure.\nLayer 2 DePINs: software-based solutions for decentralized storage, computing, and other digital services.\n\nBy deploying last-mile broadband in underserved regions, Dabba also expands opportunities for other DePIN projects to scale and reach new markets. For example, WeatherXM is a decentralized weather data network that leverages Dabba\u2019s infrastructure to reduce deployment barriers in India. This model allows hotspot owners to host multiple DePIN applications on the same hardware, earning additional token rewards without additional hardware.\n\nTokenomics\n\nThe Dabba Token (DBT) will function as the core utility token within the Dabba Network. It is set to launch on Solana in March 2025 and will be used to reward stakeholders for their contributions to the network and incentivize their sustained participation as the ecosystem expands.\n\nDBT\u2019s token model will have both inflationary and deflationary mechanisms. DBT will be minted daily to compensate network contributors, while simultaneously, tokens will be burned through multiple mechanisms, including data consumption, onboarding fees, and other use cases within the ecosystem.\n\nHotspot Owners: receive 100% of daily ecosystem rewards but must distribute DBT to other stakeholders to maintain operations. Hotspot attachment and leasing require a DBT stake.\nLocal Cable Operators: paid in DBT for installing hotspots and maintaining network uptime. Compensation is performance-based to reward LCOs with higher service reliability. LCOs currently receive fiat payments for deploying hotspots and will begin earning DBT once the token is released.\nBackhaul Providers: earn DBT for providing and maintaining the infrastructure required to deliver bandwidth to LCOs.\nLocation Owners: receive DBT for hosting hotspots in high-traffic areas. In addition to DBT, they stand to benefit from increased foot traffic and customer engagement as more individuals are drawn to the location for internet access.\nHardware Manufacturers: earn DBT for creating, maintaining, and upgrading hotspot devices within the network.\n\nConsumers connect to Dabba hotspots and access the internet by purchasing Data Credits from WiFi Dabba Inc. in Indian Rupees at a cost equivalent to $0.012 per gigabyte. For every offchain payment received for Data Credits, WiFi Dabba Inc. will acquire an equivalent value of DBT tokens and permanently remove them from circulation through a burn mechanism. This process will aim to ensure that data pricing remains stable for consumers and creates ongoing demand for DBT as network adoption grows.\n\nDBT Allocation and Vesting Schedule\n\nDBT will have a maximum total supply of 10 billion tokens. Of this amount, 40% will be allocated to WiFi Dabba Inc., the Dabba Foundation, and institutional investors. At launch, 10% of the tokens allocated toward WiFi Dabba Inc. will be unlocked. After the event, all remaining WiFi Dabba Inc. tokens will follow a two-year lock-up period and then a 24-month linear vesting schedule.\n\nThe remaining six billion DBT will be distributed to network stakeholders over a 50-year period following the token genesis event, aiming to ensure sustainable incentives for network participants. In the first year, 600 million DBT will be emitted, with annual emissions decreasing by 10% each subsequent year.\n\nThe full token allocation is as follows:\n\n36.00% to Hotspot Owners (3.60 billion DBT)\n18.00% to WiFi Dabba Inc. (1.80 billion DBT)\n18.00% to Local Cable Operators (1.80 billion DBT)\n13.54% to the Dabba Foundation (1.35 billion DBT)\n8.46% to Investors (845.60 million DBT)\n3.00% to Backhaul Providers (300.00 million DBT)\n2.40% to Location Owners (240.00 million DBT)\n0.60% to Hotspot Manufacturers (60.00 million DBT)\n\nGenesis Period Rewards\n\nAs of this writing, over 11,000 Dabba Lite hotspots have been purchased in over 50 countries since they became available for sale in November 2023. Hotspot owners who bought their devices between the launch date and the end of February 2025 have been earning daily genesis rewards. This model was discontinued on Feb. 28, 2025 and additional bonuses were announced based on the following purchase timelines:\n\nMay 21, 2024 \u2013 Aug. 30, 2024: 3,000 DBT bonus per deployed hotspot.\nSept. 1, 2024 \u2013 Feb. 28, 2025: DBT bonuses ensuring a total Genesis Reward of 20,000 DBT per activated hotspot.\n\nDBT tokens will follow a lock-up schedule and be gradually minted alongside data consumption rewards once the token launches. Following the token genesis event, hotspot owners will be able to activate and deploy their hotspots, upon which they will begin allocating a portion of their DBT daily earnings to other stakeholders for contributing to the network. \n\nNetwork Usage\n\nThe Dabba Explorer\n\nThe Dabba Explorer provides insights into network performance, financial rewards, and infrastructure deployment. It serves as a central hub for tracking hotspot activity, token interactions, and network expansion, ensuring network data is accessible and measurable.\n\nHotspot Maps\n\nThe Dabba Explorer includes an interactive map displaying hotspot deployment locations and ownership distribution in India. It also features a dedicated ownership map showing estimated hotspot owners' locations based on shipping and billing address data provided during hotspot purchases, displaying the global distribution of hotspot owners without exposing sensitive information.\n\nKey Metrics and Analytics\n\nThe explorer features multiple metrics for analyzing network performance, such as the total number of hotspots deployed, connected devices, tokens rewarded, tokens burned, and more. It also includes maps for tracking weekly metrics, including:\n\nNetwork uptime\nConnected Devices\nValue of purchased data credits\nBandwidth consumption trends\nAverage uptime of hotspot devices in the Network\nDevices connected Value of Data Credits \nTop hotspots by data consumption and performance overviews\n\nThrough these metrics, the Dabba Explorer aims to provide a transparent overview for network stakeholders and potential hotspot buyers to gauge network activity and expansion as it matures.\n\nLocal Cable Operator Analytics\n\nHotspot owners can use the Dabba Explorer to analyze and compare LCOs based on deployment and operational metrics. This provides a comparative analysis to help hotspot owners make data-driven decisions when selecting an LCO for hotspot deployment. Core metrics include:\n\nExisting deployment locations of each LCO.\nTotal active device connections per operator, using pseudonym identifiers to protect privacy.\nAverage installation times to evaluate efficiency.\nAverage uptime performance to assess service reliability.\n\nRoadmap & Partnerships\n\nAs the network scales, Dabba plans to expand to other emerging markets to meet the needs of additional underserved regions. Additionally, the project\u2019s GitBook outlines several key areas of future infrastructure and ecosystem development:\n\nRoadmap\n\nTelecom Integration\n\nIn the future, Dabba Network aims to serve as a neutral offload host for telecom providers to reduce their network congestion and lower associated costs.\n\nDabba Pro Hotspot\n\nDabba Pro will be a premium hotspot device designed for enhanced network performance, dApp support, and IoT automation. Unlike Dabba Lite, which focuses on basic private WiFi access, Dabba Pro will offer higher-capacity connectivity and optimized data throughput for more demanding applications.\n\nThrough a Home Assistant integration, the Dabba Pro will enable users to automate and manage IoT devices. This will expand its functionality beyond internet access into smart home and industrial automation.\n\nDeveloper Ecosystem and dApp Store\n\nTo support dApp deployment and management, Dabba is building a developer ecosystem centered around the upcoming Dabba Developer Network and a community-operated dApp Store. These platforms will provide infrastructure for dApp creation and allow developers to publish and maintain applications using DBT tokens.\n\nDabba Pro hotspot owners will have full control over which dApps run on their devices, allowing for a customizable experience. To accelerate adoption, the Dabba Foundation plans to launch a developer program by the end of 2025 that will offer resources and incentives for dApp development.\n\nDabba Laser\n\nDabba is developing the Dabba Laser, a high-speed optical backhaul system designed to deliver fiber-like speeds using laser-based wireless transmission. Each Dabba Laser unit is designed to cover distances of up to five kilometers with a projected throughput of 10 Gbps, outperforming traditional wireless backhaul solutions. Additionally, the Dabba Laser will also feature an AI-alignment mechanism to maintain accurate alignment between laser transmitters and receivers.\n\nOnce released, the Dabba Laser will be installed across urban rooftops and high-rise structures to complement existing backhaul providers and eliminate the need for digging and laying new underground fiber-optic cables.\n\nDBT Staking\n\nOnce DBT has been launched, Dabba will implement a staking mechanism that will allow users to lock DBT tokens to earn rewards. This system aims to reduce token circulation and incentivize long-term contributions to the network.\n\nThe Dabba Explorer Wallet\n\nAlso following the launch of DBT, the Dabba explorer will offer an embedded wallet, enabling hotspot owners to use prepaid stores for transferring DBT to other stakeholders in the network. If the owner fails to maintain a sufficient balance, rewards will be paused, and late fees or eventual lease termination may occur.\n\nPartnerships\n\nAs the Dabba Network continues to mature, Dabba plans to collaborate with various companies and protocols to scale its infrastructure. As of Q1 2025, Dabba has already secured two partnerships:\n\nAnimoca Brands Japan: Dabba has partnered with Animoca Brands Japan to drive the adoption of Dabba Lite Wi-Fi hotspots in Japan. Through this collaboration, Japanese residents can access tiered discounts for bulk purchases of Dabba Lite hotspots. Looking ahead, the partnership plans to introduce \u201cDabba Quests,\u201d which are expected to provide opportunities to earn DBT rewards.\nWeatherXM: Dabba has partnered with WeatherXM to facilitate the deployment of over 800 WeatherXM weather stations across India. As part of this collaboration, Dabba hotspot owners provide the necessary infrastructure to support WeatherXM\u2019s network and receive WXM rewards in return.\n\nClosing Summary\n\nDabba is developing a DePIN marketplace through its Dabba Network to expand internet access in India. By leveraging DBT incentives to coordinate local and global stakeholders, the network seeks to address scalability challenges faced by traditional telecom providers. With over 11,000 Dabba Lite hotspots sold ahead of its token genesis event and nearly 75,000 connected devices, it has already demonstrated early adoption and demand.\n\nAs a Layer Zero DePIN, Dabba Network has facilitated the deployment of over 800 WeatherXM stations in India and has the capacity to support additional decentralized infrastructure projects. As the network scales, it is positioned to help bridge connectivity gaps in India and expand its model to other emerging markets.", "published_on": "2025-03-13T15:00:00Z", "url": "https://messari.io/article/understanding-dabba-a-comprehensive-overview", "source": "Messari", "author": "Austin Freimuth", "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.051994766062562654, "subjectivity": 0.3312810917895663, "sentiment": "neutral"}, "entities": ["solana"], "topics": ["dabba", "hotspot", "network", "owner"]}, {"id": "bacfc878-ebbe-458a-85fe-8a31174e3e27", "title": "State of Flow Q4 2024", "body": "Key Insights\n\nFlow launched EVM equivalence via Flow EVM. This was a part of the Crescendo upgrade in September, which introduced several technological upgrades including the upgraded Cadence 1.0 programming language\nTVL (USD) grew 91.6% QoQ to $37.7 million as the introduction of EVM equivalence led to an expansion of Flow\u2019s DeFi ecosystem.\nNBA Top Shot and NFL All Day remained Flow\u2019s most active applications.

Flow launched in May 2020 and was designed for \u201ca new generation of games, apps, and the digital assets that power them.\u201d Flow was one of the first networks to implement account abstractions and user experience enhancements that made it easier for developers to onboard consumers. Today, Flow\u2019s top applications include those based on world-class brands, such as NBA Top Shot and NFL All Day.\n\nOn Flow, developers use \u201cCadence,\u201d Flow\u2019s novel programming language. Flow\u2019s most recent development came via a network upgrade called \u201cCrescendo.\u201d In <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/b9009950-e9a0-4e4f-9355-28508482d04b\">September 2024</a>, Flow introduced Cadence 1.0 with the Crescendo upgrade, bringing EVM equivalence to Flow via a separate Flow EVM environment. Now, developers can use Solidity to build on Flow EVM with block times of 800 milliseconds. Furthermore, developers can tap into existing tools and liquidity across the EVM, while users experience sub-cent transaction fees.\n\nFlow has played a significant role in onboarding consumers into crypto by pioneering the ERC-721 token standard via CryptoKitties in 2017 and putting NFT collectibles into the mainstream via NBA Top Shot in 2021. Today, Flow continues to innovate and be a foundational part of the industry\u2019s effort to bring new users into the space. For a full primer on Flow, refer to our <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/understanding-flow-a-comprehensive-overview\">Initiation of Coverage</a>.\n\nWebsite / X / Discord / Telegram\n\nKey Metrics\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nFLOW is the native token of Flow that is used (i) as the primary medium of exchange on Flow and (ii) for staking to facilitate various staking-related functions. FLOW\u2019s price increased 19.5% to $0.70 in Q4 2024, with the highest point in the quarter being $1.22 on Dec. 4, 2024. FLOW\u2019s market cap increased a similar 21% QoQ to $1.08 billion, with the slight discrepancy being due to a 1.2% increase in circulating supply up to 1.55 billion. Despite the QoQ increase in price, FLOW\u2019s circulating market cap rank fell from 77th to 89th.\n\nProject-related catalysts that may have impacted investor behavior and FLOW\u2019s Q4\u201924 price movements include the Crescendo upgrade, which introduced EVM equivalence and drove an increase in DeFi activity. Additionally, the Flow Community Rewards pre-season offered up to a 15% boost on FLOW tokens that were locked for the pre-season\u2019s one-month duration. Upon the pre-season\u2019s conclusion on Sept. 30, 2024, $17.4 million worth of FLOW tokens, or 30 million FLOW, had been locked.\n\nFLOW is used to settle network transaction fees on Flow. The total transaction fee for any transaction on Flow comprises a variable \u201cexecution fee\u201d plus a fixed \u201cinclusion fee,\u201d which is then multiplied by a \u201csurge factor.\u201d Network transaction fees are negligible on Flow, with quarterly fees (USD) reaching only $1,317 in Q4\u201924. Still, that was an increase of 138.2% QoQ as quarterly fees (FLOW) reached 1,689.\n\nNetwork Analysis\n\nFlow\u2019s average daily active addresses (DAAs) increased 47.8% QoQ to 27,440, while average daily transactions (txs) increased 11.9% QoQ to 251,100. The ratio of transactions to active addresses (txs/DAAs) decreased 24.3% QoQ to 9.2, suggesting activity is being distributed more evenly across users; conversely, an increasing ratio suggests a rise in \u201cpower users.\u201d\n\nThese trends could have been driven by two major factors. First, the Crescendo upgrade introduced EVM equivalence and drove an increase in activity. Second, the seasonal nature of Flow\u2019s top applications, NBA Top Shot, and NFL All Day. Both applications experience increases in activity during their regular seasons that overlap in Q4 of every year. These factors likely contributed to the increase in DAAs and transactions on Flow.\n\nFLOW\u2019s initial token supply was 1.25 billion upon Flow\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/5d87ed06-89c8-4e5b-bde9-4910fd0567d7\">Mainnet v1</a>\u201d <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/fb5b8c86-6f37-4a21-8a97-2e26358e82e3\">launch</a> in October 2020. However, the total token supply experiences inflation once per epoch (approximately once a week) due to inflationary staking rewards distributed to Flow\u2019s validator nodes and delegators. Inflation over an annual period is equivalent to 5% of FLOW\u2019s total token supply.\n\nAs explained in our <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/understanding-flow-a-comprehensive-overview\">Initiation of Coverage</a>, combined weekly staking rewards comprise all network transaction fees, with any remaining amount being minted as inflationary staking rewards.\n\nStakers, including validator nodes that have self-staked, receive 92% of weekly staking rewards proportional to their stake.\nValidator nodes also receive 8% of weekly staking rewards as commission.\n\nAs of Feb. 24, 2024, FLOW\u2019s total token supply has increased to 1.56 billion, and weekly inflation equates to approximately 1.5 million FLOW per week. As of the same date, 462.2 million FLOW (29.6% of the total token supply) is staked by 469 validator nodes, while 208.3 million FLOW (18.1% of the total token supply) is staked by 45,965 delegators. Validation APY is 11.65%, and delegation APY is 10.72%.\n\nCrescendo Upgrade\n\nFlow\u2019s programming language is dubbed \u201cCadence,\u201d and was inspired by Libra\u2019s Diem, which aimed to utilize a novel, resource-oriented programming language called \u201cMove.\u201d Thus, Cadence became a resource-oriented programming language, meaning it defines when an onchain asset is of tangible value. When a resource is defined, special rules must be followed, like that a (i) resource can only exist in one place, (ii) it has ownership defined by where it is stored, and (iii) certain onchain actions can only be performed by the owner of the resource.\n\nSmart contract development on Flow has historically been limited to Cadence for developers. However, Flow\u2019s most recent network upgrade introduced an updated version of Cadence. In October 2023, a proposal to achieve EVM equivalence on Flow was <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/4ce443ec-67b6-4ebe-b31b-9077e70abb48\">introduced</a>. In December 2023, a formal upgrade to Cadence 1.0, dubbed \u201cCrescendo,\u201d was announced. In March 2024, the \u201cPreviewnet\u201d to test the Crescendo upgrade went live. Finally, on <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/b9009950-e9a0-4e4f-9355-28508482d04b\">Sept. 4, 2024</a>, Flow introduced Cadence 1.0 with the Crescendo upgrade, bringing EVM equivalence to Flow via a separate Flow EVM environment.\n\nThe Crescendo upgrade introduced (i) cross-chain token transfers between EVM-based networks and Flow, (ii) increased state storage efficiency, (iii) and reduced block times to 800 milliseconds. Additionally, Cadence 1.0 introduced (i) capabilities and entitlements that allow for granular permissions to be set by developers, (ii) updated transaction logic capabilities that enable developers to sponsor gas for users, (iii) custom metadata for improved asset interoperability and information visibility, and (iv) attachments that allow for the alteration of pre-existing assets.\n\nNow, developers can use Solidity to build on Flow EVM, which still uses FLOW to pay network transaction fees. Composability between Flow EVM and Flow is achieved as EVM-based transactions are nested within Cadence-based transactions inside the same block. Specifically, Cadence Owned Accounts (COAs) are smart contract wallets on Flow EVM that allow users (resource owners) on Flow to call and control their Flow EVM address.\n\nEcosystem Analysis\n\nConsumer\n\nFlow\u2019s ecosystem largely comprises consumer-oriented applications. However, Flow\u2019s top NFT projects do not include traditional profile picture (PFP) projects. Rather, they include Flow\u2019s suite of collectible, sports, and gaming-related applications, which heavily utilize NFTs.\n\nThe NFT ecosystem on Flow is the most active sector on the network. Average daily NFT sales on Flow increased 31% QoQ to 10,052 in Q4 2024, while average daily NFT trading volume (USD) increased 26.7% to $122,380.\n\nFlow\u2019s two native NFT marketplaces are Flowverse and Flowty. Mintify is a multi-chain NFT marketplace that went live on Flow EVM on Oct. 1, 2024. Mintify\u2019s SZN4 points program is active, and users on Flow EVM earn XP for buying, bidding, listing, and minting NFTs via Mintify. Flow\u2019s top collectible NFT projects include:\n\nThe officially licensed Mattel Hot Wheels and Barbie collectibles.\n  Hot Wheels Garage V2 trading volume decreased 11.5% QoQ to $0.31 million.\nThe officially licensed Disney, Pixar, and Star Wars collectibles via Disney Pinnacle.\n  Disney Pinnacle holds regular digital pin collectible mints, such as Disney Villains Halloween Vol.1, Winnie the Pooh Vol.1, Pixar Playtime Badges Vol.1, Merry Stitchmas Vol.1, Disney Princess Holiday Vol.1, Star Wars Comic Humor Vol.1, Pixar's Finding Dory Vol.1, etc.\nThe officially licensed Star Wars, Disney, and Mattel\u2019s Master of the Universe collectibles via Cryptoys, which raised $30 million during its early years.\n  In August 2024, Cryptoys launched two NFT marketplaces, Toyken Market and the Digital Toy Exchange, allowing users to trade Cryptoys NFTs. Additionally, a partnership with 8k Games was announced which plans to introduce games into the Cryptoys ecosystem.\nThroughout Q4\u201924 Cryptoys launched various collectibles, such as Donald Duck, Daisy Duck, and Goofy. Cryptoys also gave pre-alpha access to several conceptual minigames.\n\nFlow\u2019s most popular applications stem from some of the world\u2019s largest Sport IPs. NFT trading volume on Flow is dominated by NBA Top Shot and NFL All Day, which made up 87.5% of all NFT trading volume in Q4\u201924 at $9.9 million. Activity on both apps is cyclical. Overall activity trends up during the NBA and NFL seasons which span from September to April, and falls back down when neither league is active in July and August.\n\nNBA Top Shot: The most active app on Flow. Top Shot allows users to collect officially licensed NBA collectibles (moments) by purchasing packs or trading the moments. Moments can also be used to compete and play in prediction competitions.\n  In Q4, NBA Top Shot trading volume (USD) increased 25.8% to $6.2 million. Last season\u2019s NBA Championship game was played on June 17, 2024. The new season began on Oct. 24, 2024, which resulted in the highest monthly trading volume since April 2024, at $2.5 million.\nNFL All Day: Following the same concept, All Day allows users to collect officially licensed NFL collectibles (moments) by purchasing packs or trading the moments. Moments can also be used to compete and play in challenges and tournaments.\n  In Q4, NFL All Day trading volume (USD) increased 68.7% to $3.6 million, starting an uptrend due to the NFL season kicking off on Sept. 5, 2024. The aerage monthly trading volume from September to December was $1.3 million, up 203% from the average of $0.42 million during the offseason from March to July.\n\nFlow\u2019s gaming sector emerged in 2023 with the launches of two initial games, one of which, the Metaverse Football League (MFL), remains the highlight of Flow\u2019s gaming sector.\n\nMetaverse Football League: A soccer management game that lets users control their team, progress players, participate in tournaments, set tactics, and play matches. Users can purchase packs and trade players or clubs via the application, with MFL having seen over $1 million in all-time trading volume. The project also has a soul-bound MFL token which serves to facilitate rewards and pack purchasing.\n  In Q4, MFL trading volume (USD) increased 73.6% to $0.33 million. MFL continued to work on shipping upgrades like player aging, development, and contracts. MFL also shipped social features, putting on the Community Clash tournament and its first-ever season that included various rewards. Season 2 began in December 2024.\nCryptoKitties: The original NFT project launched by Flow\u2019s founders, resurfaced the old IP by launching CryptoKitties: All The Zen on Flow EVM on Oct. 1, 2024.\n  Originally announced in September with a waitlist, All The Zen is a Telegram-based game that later hit over 100,000 active addresses. Players interact with the \u201cBig Egg\u201d to earn ZEN, an offchain token that is used to hatch and upgrade \u201cFancy Kitties.\u201d The game operates under a seasons model beginning with Season One. New seasons will bring changes to gameplay and mechanics.\nDimension X: A free-to-play, idle role playing game (RPG) that launched on Aug. 8, 2023. Users can create a team of heroes, customize cosmetics, quest, and level up.\n  In Q2 and Q3, the Dimension X team shifted focus on a new game called Arena Boyz. Arena Boyz is an onchain, turn-based battle royale game. A comprehensive gameplay demo can be seen here.\n\nDeFi\n\nFlow\u2019s total value locked (TVL) increased 91.6% QoQ to $37.7 million. While Flow\u2019s TVL has historically lagged more DeFi-focused networks, that was addressed with Flow\u2019s Crescendo upgrade, which occurred on Sept. 4, 2024, and introduced EVM equivalence via a separate Flow EVM environment.\n\nWhile activity on Flow EVM was muted upon launch, DeFi protocols began to emerge on Flow EVM testnet while Moralis, Alchemy, Quicknode, Pyth, and Gelato launched support for infrastructure and developer tooling. In Q4\u201924, Flow\u2019s DeFi ecosystem finally experienced significant growth as its DeFi diversity score (i.e., the number of protocols making up 90% of a network\u2019s TVL) increased 300% from one to three. Flow\u2019s EVM-based DeFi ecosystem has started to emerge.\n\nIncrement Finance: Historically, the lone DeFi protocol on Flow which comprised the entirety of TVL on the network. Increment is a full-suite DeFi protocol that allows for trading, lending/borrowing, liquid staking, farming, and a points program.\n  Increment ended the year with a TVL of $28.5 million, up 49.2% QoQ for a total share of 75.3% of Flow\u2019s TVL. Notably, as more DeFi protocols launched in Q4, Increment\u2019s total market share of TVL decreased 24.7% QoQ.\nTrado Finance: A spot and perpetual decentralized exchange (DEX) that launched on Flow EVM testnet in September, before launching on mainnet on Oct. 5, 2024.\n  Trado ended the year with a TVL of $5.2 million, good for a total share of 13.7% of Flow\u2019s TVL. The protocol deployed FLOW token incentives to liquidity providers throughout Q4\u201924 which drove trading activity.\nKittyPunch: A full-suite DeFi protocol that launched on Flow EVM on Sept. 8, 2024. KittyPunch offers (i) a spot DEX (PunchSwap), (ii) a stableswap DEX (StableKitty), (iii) a spot DEX aggregator (AggroKitty), (iv) a token launchpad (Trenches), (v) an NFT marketplace (Hoard), and (vi) a bridge powered by Hyperlane (KittyPunch Bridge).\n  KittyPunch ended the year with a TVL of $3.4 million, good for a total share of 8.9% of Flow\u2019s TVL. The protocol deployed FLOW token incentives to liquidity providers throughout Q4\u201924 which drove trading activity as KittyPunch emerged as one of the fastest growing DeFi protocols on Flow.\n  KittyPunch launched a various new products in Q4\u201924; (i) a token launchpad dubbed \u201cTrenches,\u201d (ii) indices that include a variety of tokens (Trench Index, Flow Meme Index, Top Shot Index), (iii) a stableswap DEX dubbed \u201cStableKitty,\u201d (iv) an AI Agent under the name \u201cSergeant Fatfinger,\u201d and (v) an NFT marketplace dubbed \u201cHoard.\u201d\n  KittyPunch plans to launch a yield aggregator dubbed \u201cPunch Vaults,\u201d which will employ DeFi strategies on deposited assets.\n  In Q4\u201924, pump.flow launched after it was created at Flow\u2019s ETHGlobal Singapore hackathon. The project is a memecoin launchpad similar to pump.fun where bonded tokens have liquidity seeded on PunchSwap.\nMORE Markets: A borrowing and lending protocol that launched on Flow EVM testnet in September, before launching on mainnet on Oct. 2, 2024. MORE Markets offered two initial vaults for FLOW and ankrFLOW, and has since expanded to stgUSDC, WETH, and USDF.\n  MORE Markets ended the year with a TVL of $0.8 million, good for a total share of 2.1% of Flow\u2019s TVL.\n\nNotably, in Q4\u201924, in addition to the launch of pump.flow, the following memecoin launchpads were announced.\n\nPrintr: An in-development, multi-chain launchpad where tokens can be launched across 69+ networks, including Flow. Printr will be powered by interoperability solutions like Axelar and Squid Router, and is currently open for waitlist registration.\nFlowFun: An in-development, Flow EVM-native meme and NFT launchpad that went live on testnet in December 2024.\n\nLiquid Staking & Stablecoins\n\nThe liquid staking sector on Flow has historically been limited to Increment Finance\u2019s stFLOW token, which has ranged between a TVL of roughly $5 to $10 million throughout Q2 and Q3 2024. However, a new entrant appeared on Sept. 10, 2024, as Ankr launched its liquid staking token, ankrFLOW, on Flow EVM. ankrFLOW grew quickly, reaching a TVL of $3.7 million by the end of Q3. In Q4, liquid staking TVL (USD) on Flow grew 90.1% QoQ to $17.7 million. Both of Flow\u2019s liquid staking protocols experienced significant growth, as Increment\u2019s stFLOW grew 97.9% QoQ to $11.1 million while Ankr\u2019s ankrFLOW grew 78.5% to $6.6 million.\n\nAs for stablecoins, in August 2024, Circle announced it would be discontinuing native support for USDC on Flow on Sept. 3, 2024. This was driven by upcoming network changes associated with the Crescendo upgrade. However, various bridges have integrated Flow EVM and allow ETH (WETH on Flow EVM), Circle\u2019s USDC (USDC.e and stgUSDC on Flow EVM), and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD (USDF on Flow EVM) to be bridged to Flow EVM.\n\nDevelopment, Growth, and Community\n\nFlow World Tour Hackathons\n\nDeveloper activity on Flow followed a general downtrend for most of 2024. Following the Crescendo Upgrade in Q4'24, average weekly core devs decreased 18.9% QoQ to 58 while average weekly commits to Flow\u2019s core repositories fell 26.9% to 412. However, ecosystem development activity picked up in the same period as average weekly ecosystem developers increased 20.9% QoQ to 104 while average weekly commits to ecosystem repositories increased 38.4% to 754\n\nThe increase in ecosystem activity was spurred in part by Flow in September 2024 with the launch of a three-month Flow World Tour consisting of four hackathons worldwide:\n\nFirst hackathon: Focused on DeFi and was held in Singapore in September. The hackathon attracted over 250 builders with over 50 applications being for projects built on Flow.\nSecond hackathon: Focused on Sports IP and composability and was held in San Francisco in October.\nThird hackathon: Focused on social applications and was held in Chiang Mai during the Edge City Lanna Buildathon in November.\nFourth hackathon: Held in Bangkok during ETHGlobal in November and focused on gaming applications. The hackathon attracted over 2,000 builders with 99 applications being for projects built on Flow.\n\nThe Flow World Tour concluded with the Flow Asia Hackathon, an online hackathon spanning the entire month of December with a prize pool of $10,000.\n\nFlow Rewards\n\nOn August 28, 2024, Flow Foundation funded a Flow Community Rewards pre-season, which offered up to a 15% boost on FLOW tokens that were locked for the pre-season\u2019s one-month duration. Upon the pre-season\u2019s conclusion on Sept. 30, 2024, $17.4 million worth of FLOW tokens, or 30 million FLOW, had been locked.\n\nLocked tokens, along with earned token rewards, were linearly unlocked over two months starting on Oct. 1, 2024. Throughout October and November, participants received 4.5 million FLOW tokens worth $2.6 million as of Oct. 1, 2024. Ultimately, the annualized APY of this program was approximately 75%. Notably, these locked positions were represented as Flow Rewards NFTs that could be traded on NFT marketplaces like Flowty.\n\nOn Oct. 1, 2024, Flow Rewards Season 1 began. This program introduced boxes, which could be earned by engaging with DeFi protocols, and keys, which could be earned by engaging with consumer applications. Users who locked FLOW during the Flow Community Rewards pre-season received an initial bounty of boxes and keys based on their contributions.\n\nBoxes and keys can be combined and redeemed for points, which became redeemable for in-real-life (IRL) prizes and onchain assets when the rewards store went live in November 2024.\n\nClosing Summary\n\nFlow experienced a resurgence in overall activity in Q4 2024. The Crescendo upgrade introduced EVM equivalence and drove an increase in DeFi activity. TVL (USD) grew 91.6% QoQ to $37.7 million as Flow\u2019s DeFi ecosystem grew more diverse for the first time with the launches of Trado Finance, KittyPunch, and MORE Markets on Flow EVM. Liquid staking TVL (USD) grew 90.1% QoQ to $17.7 million as both of Flow\u2019s liquid staking protocols, Increment and Ankr, experienced significant growth.\n\nWithin Flow\u2019s ecosystem, NBA Top Shot and NFL All Day remained the most active applications. Average daily NFT trading volume (USD) increased 26.7% to $122,380, while All Day averaged $39,600, a 68.7% QoQ increase as the NFL season kicked off. The Metaverse Football League (MFL) remained the highlight of Flow\u2019s gaming sector, as MFL trading volume (USD) increased 73.6% to $0.33 million.\n\nAll-in-all, with the resurgence of DeFi and NFT activity on Flow, average daily active addresses (DAAs) increased 47.8% QoQ to 27,440, while average daily transactions increased 11.9% to 251,100. Financially, FLOW\u2019s token price increased 19.5% QoQ to $0.70, but its market cap rank fell from 77th to 89th. Looking forward, Flow hopes to continue momentum sparked by Crescendo and developer momentum that has been spurred by recent Flow World Tour hackathons.", "published_on": "2025-03-13T13:00:00Z", "url": "https://messari.io/article/state-of-flow-q4-2024", "source": "Messari", "author": "Patryk Krasnicki", "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.08089303429705216, "subjectivity": 0.4400330819973678, "sentiment": "neutral"}, "entities": ["ethereum", "ethereum classic"], "topics": ["flow", "million"]}, {"id": "dc04f13d-957c-46a5-bc32-415560f927e9", "title": "State of Filecoin Q4 2024", "body": "Key Insights\n\nNew storage deals increased by 10% QoQ in Q4 2024, reaching 3.1 PiB per day, despite a 9% decline in total stored capacity.\nStorage utilization grew from 30% in Q3 to 32% in Q4, while storage capacity fell 13% QoQ, continuing the shift toward enterprise-driven, high-value storage solutions.\nAs of December 31, 2024, over 4,700 unique contracts were deployed on the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), facilitating over 3 million transactions.\nFilecoin expanded its Layer-2 ecosystem with Basin, Akave, and Storacha, improving scalability, AI adoption, and decentralized data management.\n\nPrimer\n\nFilecoin is building a marketplace for data services\u2014with the first service being storage\u2014on top of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).

Unlike storage deals, which involve transactions onchain, retrieval deals use payment channels to settle payments offchain, to enable faster retrieval. Besides storage and retrieval, Filecoin aims to offer an open market where compute power can be contracted to run over data, providing more efficient alternatives to traditional centralized systems.\n\nKey protocol upgrades to enable compute-over-data services include smart contracts (the Filecoin Virtual Machine - FVM) and scaling (Interplanetary Consensus - IPC). The launch of the FVM in March 2023 brought Ethereum-style smart contracts to enable new use cases on Filecoin, including token leasing, perpetual storage, and compute. Besides growing its FVM ecosystem, Filecoin focuses on enterprise adoption. \n\nWebsite / X (Twitter) / Discord / Slack\n\nKey Metrics\n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nThe Filecoin Network is primarily used to store data decentrally by two parties: \n\nThe demand side, i.e., storage users needing data storage.\nThe supply side, i.e., storage providers with excess storage capacity.\n\nNetwork\n\nThe amount of data stored in active deals between storage users and providers gauges the demand for Filecoin storage. \n\nDeals\n\nIn Q4 2024, around 1,500 PiB was stored on the Filecoin Network through active deals, marking a 9% QoQ decline from 1,600 PiB, reflecting a strategic pivot toward enterprise adoption and high-value storage solutions. This shift prioritized perpetual archiving, data privacy, and Web2/Web3 integrations over raw storage volume, refining storage incentives and deal structures.\n\nThis strategic pivot enhances network utilization efficiency even as aggregate storage volume experiences a temporary decline. By emphasizing enterprise adoption, compliance-ready storage, and AI-driven applications, Filecoin is cultivating a more sustainable demand model, positioning the network for stronger retention and monetization of storage deals in future quarters.\n\nUtilization vs. Capacity\n\nFilecoin\u2019s storage utilization rose to 32% in Q4 2024 from 31% in Q3, driven by a 13% drop in raw byte storage capacity (4.8 EiB to 4.2 EiB) rather than increased demand. This reflects Filecoin\u2019s shift from supply incentives to onboarding high-value enterprise storage. Since peaking at 17 EiB in Q3 2022, capacity has steadily declined as economic incentives changed, leading smaller providers to exit, with active storage providers falling to ~1,900 in Q4 2024 (down from 4,100 in Q3 2022). The network now prioritizes enterprise adoption, AI data solutions, and compliance-ready storage (e.g., DeStor, Seal, Filecoin Web Services), focusing on efficiency over sheer capacity growth.\n\nClients\n\nAs per Messari\u2019s <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/the-essential-guide-to-decentralized-storage-networks\">guide</a> on decentralized storage networks, Filecoin is geared toward providing cold storage solutions (e.g., archival and recovery) for enterprises and developers. Low storage prices help attract traditional businesses seeking cost-effective alternatives for storing large amounts of archival data. \n\nDeStor, a service provider on Filecoin that connects clients to storage providers, partnered with Qamcom DDS to enhance the security, robustness, and scalability of its services. The partnership includes data clients like YayPal, a Web3 gaming studio with over 500,000 users, and Fieldstream, an AI marketing analytics platform. Examples of other client solutions include: \n\nGhostDrive: focused on prioritizing privacy and security through encryption, decentralization, and novel storage optimization techniques;\nSeal: focused on storage onramps for large clients such as UC Berkeley, Starling Labs, the Atlas Experiment, and the Casper Network; \nCIDGravity: focused on enterprise integrations with open source platforms like Nextcloud.\n\nBeyond cold storage, other efforts are driven by storage solutions from Lighthouse, RIBS, Retriev, and Flamenco, among others.\n\nAs of the end of Q4 2024, 2,263 clients onboarded datasets on Filecoin, marking a 10% QoQ increase from 2,060 in Q3 2024. Of these, 751 clients onboarded large datasets (over 1,000 TiB), reflecting the growing demand for enterprise-scale decentralized storage. This growth was further accelerated by FIP-0092, introduced in Q3 2024 as part of the Waffle upgrade, which helped reduce entry barriers for new storage providers by implementing Non-Interactive Proof of Replication (NI-PoRep). This upgrade enhanced proving efficiency, lowered computational costs, and increased accessibility for new and existing storage providers, thereby expanding the network\u2019s storage capacity and facilitating the onboarding of larger datasets. \n\nFVM Traction\n\nWhen the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) launched in March 2023, it brought Ethereum-style smart contracts to Filecoin. As of December 31, 2024, around 4,700 unique contracts are deployed on the FVM, facilitating over 3 million transactions.\n\nIn Q4 2024, Filecoin saw total inflows of $99 million, marking a 21% increase QoQ from $82 million in Q3 2024. Meanwhile, total outflows also rose to $75 million, up 50% QoQ from $50 million in Q3 2024. This increase in deposits and borrows suggests a renewed demand for liquidity, potentially driven by an uptick in network activity or shifting market conditions that encouraged lenders and borrowers to engage more actively.\n\nOn a YoY basis, inflows in Q4 2024 were up 87% compared to $53 million in Q4 2023, reflecting an expansion in Filecoin\u2019s lending market over the past year. However, this comes after a peak in Q1 2024 ($146 million in inflows), indicating that while lending demand remains strong, it has tapered off from its early 2024 highs. Outflows also followed a similar trend, rising 73% YoY from $43 million in Q4 2023 but staying below the Q1 2024 peak of $108 million.\n\nThe QoQ rise in deposits and borrows in Q4 2024 could be attributed to seasonal trends, network incentives, or increased demand for FIL-backed loans amid market volatility. Additionally, the FIL-denominated inflows (21 million FIL) and outflows (15 million FIL) remained relatively stable compared to previous quarters, suggesting that much of the USD fluctuation was driven by FIL price movements (+30% QoQ) rather than a dramatic shift in lending activity. \n\nFinancial Overview\n\nFilecoin's revenue model shares similarities with Ethereum due to its EIP-1559-inspired gas system, where a portion of network fees is burned to regulate congestion. However, unlike Ethereum, Filecoin\u2019s economy is storage-driven, with storage users paying fees and storage providers earning revenue while managing collateral and penalties.\n\nFees\n\nAs per Messari's <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/demystifying-filecoin-s-revenue\">revenue analysis</a>, Filecoin's fees comprise of:\n\nBase fees \u2013 Determined by blockspace congestion and required by any storage proof.\nBatch fees \u2013 Used for bundling storage proofs to optimize costs.\nOverestimation fees \u2013 Required to optimize gas usage. \nPenalty fees \u2013 Collected for storage provider failures. \n\nIn Q4 2024, Filecoin\u2019s fee structure saw a 399% QoQ increase in Base Fees ($560,000), signaling increased network activity and congestion, likely tied to higher transaction volumes and storage proofs. Overestimation Fees increased 508% QoQ ($35,000), reflecting inefficiencies in gas estimation amid fluctuating demand. Batch Fees rose 28% QoQ ($189,000), indicating greater reliance on cost-saving batch processing for storage proofs. Meanwhile, Penalty Fees declined 13% QoQ ($520,000), suggesting improved storage provider reliability. These shifts align with higher FIL inflows and borrowing activity, pointing to growing onchain engagement and network stability heading into 2025.\n\nMarket Cap\n\nIn Q4 2024, Filecoin\u2019s circulating market cap increased 36% QoQ to $3.0 billion, up from $2.2 billion in Q3 2024, alongside a 30% QoQ rise in FIL\u2019s price to $4.9 in Q4 2024 from $3.8 in Q3 2024. Circulating supply grew 5% QoQ to 617 million FIL, maintaining a consistent issuance rate. On a YoY basis, the market cap declined 12% from $3.4 billion in Q4 2023, despite FIL\u2019s price rising 30% YoY from $3.8. \n\nQualitative Analysis\n\nKey Developments\n\nFilecoin \"Tuk Tuk\" Upgrade (NV24): The NV24 Tuk Tuk Upgrade was announced in Q4 2024, bringing major enhancements to network efficiency, security, and developer experience.  \nThis upgrade incorporates several Filecoin Improvement Proposals (FIPs), including:\n\nFIP-0081: Adjusted the sector initial pledge mechanism, ensuring economic stability during fluctuations in storage growth.\nFIP-0094: Enhanced Filecoin Ethereum Virtual Machine (FEVM) by enabling support for EIP-5656, optimizing memory operations in smart contracts.\nFIP-0095: Introduced a FEVM precompile for retrieving randomness from chain history, improving smart contract performance and security.\n\nFilecoin Fast Finality (F3): The Fast Finality (F3) upgrade aims to reduce transaction finality times on the Filecoin network significantly.

This dual governance model allows TNSR to capture revenue from both the NFT market and the broader token trading landscape.\nThe TNSR token allows holders to participate in governance, direct a growing treasury that accrues protocol revenue, and receive fee discounts on both Tensor and Vector platforms.\nTNSR is strategically aligned with the hyperfinancialization trend in DeFi, where the proliferation of tokenized assets creates new market opportunities. This strategy is meant to index on long tail assets from NFTs to Memes and beyond.\n\nPrimer\n\nThe Tensor DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) governs two protocols: Tensor, an NFT marketplace on Solana, and Vector, a cross-chain social trading application. Through the TNSR token, the DAO enables community-driven governance, allowing tokenholders to participate in decisions impacting both protocols. A portion of the fees generated by Tensor and Vector is directed to the DAO's treasury, which is managed by the TNSR community.\n\nTensor\n\nTensor is a leading NFT marketplace on Solana, launched in July 2022. It is known for integrating an Automated Market Maker (AMM) to enhance liquidity. It supports traditional listings, bids, and collection-wide bids. Tensor has done ~17 million SOL in volume to date.\n\nWebsite / X (Twitter)\n\nVector\n\nVector is a social trading application developed by Tensor Labs Inc., designed to manage digital assets, track real-time prices, and execute trades across multiple blockchains like Solana and Ethereum. It integrates unique social features, such as \"Broadcasts\" for publicly sharing trading activity and private groups for focused discussions, fostering community engagement. The application includes a fee program where group leaders and referrers can earn a portion of trading fees, incentivizing participation. Vector aims to capitalize on the growing trend of social trading while expanding the Tensor ecosystem beyond NFTs. Vector has done ~$500 million USD in volume to date.\n\nWebsite / X (Twitter)\n\nTensor DAO\n\nThe Tensor DAO oversees both the Tensor NFT Marketplace and the Vector Social Trading application through a decentralized, community-driven governance model. It allows TNSR tokenholders to participate in decisions affecting these platforms.\n\nThe Tensor DAO follows a structured governance process with three main phases:\n\nDiscussions on Research Forums: Governance starts with community discussions on the Tensor DAO research forums. Members can propose changes, like protocol updates or operational adjustments, and discuss them for at least 14 days. This time allows for feedback and refinement.\nVoting on the Realms Platform: Proposals then move to the Realms platform, where TNSR tokenholders vote based on their token holdings. Submitting a proposal requires at least 250,000 TNSR. Voting occurs over three days, followed by a two-day cool-off period. A proposal is successful if it receives (i) more \"Yes\" than \"No\" votes, and (ii) at least 10 million \"Yes\" votes.\nSecurity Council Review: A seven-member Security Council from the Solana development community reviews successful proposals within seven days. They can reject proposals that might harm the system. Council members are rewarded $1,000 (in TNSR tokens) monthly for their oversight.\n\nProposals in the Tensor DAO fall into three categories:\n\nProtocol Proposals: These focus on the operations of Tensor and Vector, such as adjusting fees to improve liquidity or user incentives.\nGovernance Process Proposals: These address the DAO\u2019s rules, like modifying the TNSR threshold for submitting proposals.\nOperational Proposals: These involve broader efforts, such as marketing or branding to support the platforms.\n\nTNSR Tokenomics and Value Accrual\n\nThe TNSR token serves as the governance token for the Tensor DAO. Its tokenomics are structured to promote community ownership, while its value accrual mechanisms are linked to the revenue streams generated by the two protocols.\n\nSupply and Distribution\n\nTNSR\u2019s token supply is fixed at 1 billion. The initial distribution prioritizes the community, with 55.00% allocated as follows:\n\nAirdrops:\n  12.50%: Distributed in an initial airdrop to early supporters.\n  2.30%: Allocated to power users, vested over two years with a six-month cliff.\n  4.00%: Airdropped to active users.\nCommunity Treasury: The remaining 36.20% is held in the DAO-managed treasury.\n\nThe remaining supply is distributed to other stakeholders:\n\nCore Contributors: 27.00%\nInvestors & Advisors: 9.00%\n\nReserve: 9.00% (designated for future fundraising and development)\n\nVesting schedules apply to certain allocations to ensure long-term alignment:\n\nCore Contributors, Investors & Advisors: Three-year linear vesting with a one-year cliff, starting in March 2024.\nCommunity Treasury: Half of this allocation (18.10% of the total token supply) vests linearly over three years without a cliff.\n  The other half of the Community Treasury (18.10% of the total token supply) and the Reserve (9.00% of the total token supply) have no vesting restrictions.\n\nWhile the initial supply is fixed, the community can vote on future inflation proposals, introducing a governance-driven mechanism that could adjust the token supply over time.\n\nValue Accrual Mechanisms\n\nThe TNSR token captures value through its utility in governance, fee discounts, and revenue contributions from the Tensor and Vector protocols. These mechanisms associate the token\u2019s value to the ecosystem\u2019s growth and activity.\n\nGovernance Participation\n\nTNSR holders wield governance power, enabling them to propose and vote on changes to both Tensor and Vector. This includes decisions on fee structures, protocol upgrades, and treasury allocations, directly linking the token\u2019s utility to the platforms\u2019 strategic direction and success.\n\nFee Discounts\n\nHolding TNSR provides economic incentives through reduced fees:\n\nTensor: Users listing NFTs with TNSR receive a 25% discount on protocol fees.\nVector: TNSR holders can tip traders in app with their TNSR.\n\nRevenue Inflows to the DAO Treasury\n\nThe Tensor DAO treasury receives a portion of protocol-generated fees:\n\nVector: 50% of its revenue, derived from a flat 1% trading fee, flows to the treasury.\nTensor: Like Vector, 50% of marketplace fees accrue to the Tensor DAO. It should be noted that the direct flow of these fees into the treasury is currently being implemented.\n\nThe community controls Treasury funds, which can be used for initiatives such as airdrops, grants, or development projects. Currently the foundation address holds ~182 million TNSR and ~2.8 million USDC (worth ~$80 million).\n\nSynergies Between Protocols\n\nThe relationship between Tensor and Vector strengthens the TNSR ecosystem. Tensor's established position in the Solana NFT market provides a robust user base and technical foundation, supporting Vector's expansion into multichain social trading. In turn, Vector's diverse revenue streams bolster the treasury, creating a complementary dynamic that enhances the token's value proposition.\n\nThis dual-protocol structure provides volume diversification, particularly valuable amid shifting market trends. While 2024-2025 has witnessed a broad decline in NFT trading activity across the industry, the memecoin ecosystem has gained considerable traction in the same period. This market evolution highlights the strategic advantage of Tensor DAO's diversified approach.\n\nThrough 2025, Tensor has averaged a daily volume of ~$460,000 through the broader NFT market contraction.\n\nSimultaneously, Vector has captured substantial trading volume in the expanding trading app sector, averaging ~$7.2 million in daily volume in 2025 so far. As evidenced by Vector's higher volumes compared to Tensor, token trading is an inherently higher volume sector.\n\nBy being exposed to two distinct verticals, treasury inflows can grow regardless of which asset class dominates the market cycle. While Tensor profited during a higher activity NFT trading period, Vector's growth in the token trading space now contributes to a larger addressable market of volumes, highlighting the structural advantage of operating across multiple digital asset categories.\n\nThe Hyperfinancialization Thesis and TNSR\n\nHyperfinancialization describes the transformative shift in decentralized finance (DeFi) where asset creation and trading become accessible to anyone, leading to an unprecedented proliferation of tokenized assets. Unlike traditional finance (TradFi), where asset creation was confined to elite institutions like investment banks and venture capitalists, crypto empowers individuals to tokenize and assign value to virtually anything\u2014digital art, news, attention, or even AI outputs. This democratization has already produced hundreds of millions of assets. In this hyper-liquid, asset-rich ecosystem, platforms that enable the creation, trading, and valuation of these new financial instruments are poised to thrive. TNSR, through its governance of the Tensor NFT Marketplace and Vector Social Trading application, is strategically positioned to capitalize on this paradigm shift.\n\nHyperfinancialization: Redefining Asset Creation\n\nIn TradFi, the ability to create tradeable assets was a privilege of the few, requiring significant capital and institutional backing. Crypto upends this model by allowing anyone with an internet connection to mint and trade assets, from cryptocurrencies to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and beyond. This has led to a first-order effect: an explosion of assets in circulation. The second-order effect is more profound\u2014everything that can be tokenized will be tokenized. Examples include:\n\nNews and Information: Articles or data feeds with prices tied to their relevance or impact.\nAttention and Influence: Social tokens representing individuals\u2019 or communities\u2019 engagement metrics.\nAI Outputs: Tokenized access to machine learning predictions or creative works.\n\nThis trend creates a dynamic, ever-expanding market where value is continuously priced and exchanged, necessitating adaptable platforms to manage the complexity and volume of these new asset classes.\n\nTNSR\u2019s Strategic Positioning\n\nTNSR governs Tensor and Vector, two protocols tailored for a hyperfinancialized world:\n\nTensor: A leading Solana NFT marketplace with infrastructure to handle diverse tokenized assets beyond traditional NFTs, leveraging its Automated Market Maker (AMM).\nVector: A cross-chain social trading application that supports community-driven asset valuation through social features, ideal for pricing novel tokenized entities.\n\nTNSR\u2019s inclusion of Vector into its coverage universe expands the addressable market of the token and the protocol, allowing investors to capture a previously untapped portion of the crypto market.\n\nGovernance and Value Capture\n\nTNSR tokenholders possess dual governance influence over the Tensor NFT marketplace and Vector social trading platform, enabling community-driven adaptability across distinct asset trading ecosystems. This governance model creates a symbiotic relationship between protocols\u2014Tensor's established NFT infrastructure complements Vector's cross-chain trading capabilities, while the combined fee structure channels revenue directly to the DAO treasury. As the variety and volume of tokenized assets expand across both platforms, the treasury's revenue diversification creates a mechanism that connects TNSR's utility to the broader tokenized asset ecosystem without relying on a single market segment.\n\nClosing Summary\n\nTensor\u2019s aim is to position the asset as a leading index on all long tail assets from NFTs to Memes. To do this, Tensor DAO operates as a dual-protocol governance structure that connects traditionally separate digital asset markets. By unifying governance over both Tensor's NFT marketplace and Vector's social trading platform, the DAO creates revenue diversification that spans multiple asset classes and blockchain ecosystems. This structure positions TNSR within the broader hyperfinancialization landscape, where the proliferation of tokenized assets generates increasing trading activity across both platforms, with half of Vector's trading fees flowing directly to the community-controlled treasury.\n\nThe DAO's three-tiered governance process, supplemented by Security Council oversight, provides a balance between community participation and security considerations. With 55% of the token supply allocated to community initiatives and treasury reserves, Tensor DAO demonstrates substantial community orientation while maintaining incentive alignment through vesting schedules for core contributors and investors. This governance architecture creates a framework where the TNSR token serves not merely as a voting mechanism but as a nexus connecting distinct trading ecosystems through shared economic infrastructure.", "published_on": "2025-03-11T19:00:52Z", "url": "https://messari.io/article/tensor-dao-a-dual-protocol-ecosystem", "source": "Messari", "author": "Mike Kremer", "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.08095391243976148, "subjectivity": 0.34893255329576073, "sentiment": "neutral"}, "entities": ["ethereum", "solana"], "topics": ["tensor", "vector", "tnsr", "asset", "governance"]}, {"id": "b95aff70-404b-4761-a188-13adc814216f", "title": "State of Ethereum Q4 2024", "body": "Key Insights\n\nEthereum\u2019s TVL surged 121.6% YoY, rising from $29.9 billion to $66.3 billion, demonstrating increasing capital inflows and sustained demand for its decentralized applications. Notably, Ethereum outperformed most major Layer-2s in Q4 TVL growth, reaffirming its dominance as the primary settlement layer for blockchain-based financial activity.\nETH ETF holdings grew 63.6% QoQ, reaching 3.6 million ETH ($11.9 billion AUM), reflecting increasing institutional exposure to Ethereum. Additionally, proposals from Grayscale and 21Shares to integrate staking into ETFs could further boost staking participation and institutional ETH demand in 2025.\nEthereum maintained its dominance in DeFi and stablecoins, with Ethereum-based stablecoins growing 65.6% YoY, accounting for over half of the total $210.5 billion stablecoin supply.\nThe Pectra upgrade will introduce critical EIPs in March 2025, improving staking efficiency, transaction cost optimization, and Layer-2 scalability.\nFor the first time since the Beacon Chain launch, total staked ETH saw a slight decline, suggesting that Ethereum staking may be reaching an equilibrium as rewards decrease.\n\nPrimer\n\nEthereum (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\">ETH</a>) is a distributed blockchain computing platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications. Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts have enabled the creation of various new assets and industries, such as Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), and more. It features an execution engine optimized for smart contract processing, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). \n\nEthereum utilizes a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism where users can run validators to secure the network and participate in block production. Users who meet the hardware requirements to run the latest execution and consensus clients and deposit 32 ETH into the Beacon Deposit Contract can permissionlessly operate an Ethereum validator.\n\nEthereum has chosen a scaling strategy using a network of Layer-2 networks to meet the growing demand for blockspace. Through this strategy, Ethereum plans to scale while maintaining a high degree of decentralization. These protocols rely on Ethereum security while solely focusing on transaction execution. Ethereum underwent the <a href=\"https://messari.io/copilot?returnTo=%2F\">Dencun</a> upgrade in Q1 2024 which introduced \u201cblobs\u201d for data storage, which significantly reduced Layer-2 transaction fees. The next major upgrade is <a href=\"https://messari.io/copilot?returnTo=%2F\">Pectra</a>, which is planned for March 2025 and will introduce EIPs that will improve staking efficiency and L2 scalability. \n\nWebsite / X (Twitter) \n\nKey Metrics\n\nFinancial Overview\n\nOver the past year, ETH\u2019s price increased 41.9%, rising from $2,350 to $3,336. Despite this growth, ETH underperformed relative to BTC, which surged 119.7% YoY, climbing from $42,252 to $92,838\u2014a 40.7% performance gap. Q4 2024 was particularly strong for ETH, with its price increasing 32.7% QoQ.\n\nTotal value locked (TVL) across Ethereum and its Layer-2 networks saw substantial growth in 2024. Ethereum\u2019s TVL increased 126.7% YoY, rising from $30.2 billion to $68.3 billion, while Layer-2 TVL experienced a comparable 129.6% increase, growing from $4.4 billion to $10.1 billion. TVL increasing on both Ethereum and Layer-2s highlights the strong moat created by the EVM ecosystem and the continued demand for blockspace and applications in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nEthereum ETFs\n\nAfter a relatively slow start compared to the BTC ETFs, ETH ETF inflows accelerated in Q4\u201924, with the total amount of ETH held in ETFs rising from 2.2 million to 3.6 million\u2014a 63.6% QoQ increase\u2014bringing total assets under management (AUM) to $11.9 billion. BlackRock continued to lead in inflows, closing the year with 1.06 million ETH ($3.5 billion) under management. Meanwhile, Grayscale experienced a decline, with its ETH holdings dropping 43.1% since the launch of spot ETH ETFs in July 2024. This loss in market share may be due to investors transitioning from Grayscale\u2019s pre-existing ETHE trust to newly available ETH ETFs that offer lower fees than ETHE\u2019s 2.5% expense ratio. However, the Grayscale Mini ETH ETF demonstrated strong performance, surging 52.4% and ending the year with 452,029 ETH ($1.5 billion).\n\nEthereum Staking Landscape\n\nStaking Overview\n\nIn Q4 2024, Binance emerged as the dominant staking entity, increasing its market share by 21.3% QoQ, with staked ETH rising from 1.67 million to 2.02 million. Conversely, Coinbase experienced the most significant decline, with staked ETH dropping 13.8% QoQ, from 4.04 million to 3.49 million. The \"Others\" category also saw substantial outflows, posting a 7.5% QoQ decrease in staked ETH.\n\nFor the first time since the launch of the Beacon Chain, the total amount of staked ETH declined on a quarterly basis. However, a key potential catalyst for ETH staking in 2025 is the prospect of staking being integrated into existing ETH ETFs. With the changing regulatory landscape in the United States, the Securities and Exchange Comission has shown signs of a more open stance toward the inclusion of staking within ETF products.\n\nOn Feb. 15, 2025, the New York Stock Exchange filed a proposal with the U.S. SEC on behalf of Grayscale, seeking approval to incorporate staking into its spot Ethereum ETFs. If approved, Grayscale intends to stake Ether within its Ethereum Trust ETFs, though it does not plan to guarantee or advertise specific returns to investors.\n\nAdditionally, on Feb. 20, 2025, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) submitted a similar proposal to the SEC, requesting approval to enable staking for the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF. The SEC acknowledged the proposal, which, if approved, would make the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF the first Ethereum ETF in the United States to incorporate staking. These developments signal a potential shift in institutional ETH staking, with broader implications for market structure and investor participation.\n\nLiquid Staking\n\nDespite an overall decrease in staked ETH, liquid staking continued a broad uptrend in deposits, reflecting the appeal of liquid staking solutions. However, the \"Others\" category, which includes a mix of smaller liquid staking protocols, grew at a moderate rate, rising from $2.2 billion to $2.5 billion\u2014a 13.6% QoQ increase. \n\nDespite this growth, Ethereum staking dynamics remain closely tied to broader market conditions. The sharpest increases in staked ETH coincided with periods of price appreciation, highlighting the continued interplay between Ethereum's market momentum and staking inflows. As Ethereum's staking ecosystem matures, competition among providers is expected to intensify, potentially driving further innovation in yield optimization and staking accessibility.\n\nNetwork Overview\n\nMainnet Activity\n\nEthereum activity remained relatively stable in Q4 2024, with average daily transactions increasing 4.43%, rising from 1.19 million to 1.25 million. However, average daily active addresses (DAAs) saw a more pronounced uptick, growing 12.4% from 367,570 to 413,230 over the quarter. YoY activity remained relatively stable too, with average daily transactions increasing 13.3% and average DAAs remaining virtually unchanged.\n\nActivity was primarily driven by token movements, as wallet-to-wallet transactions rose 12.7%, stablecoin transactions increased 6.7%, and other token transactions surged 22.7%. In contrast, DeFi-related transactions declined 20.2%, while MEV-related transactions fell 33.9%, reflecting shifting dynamics within on-chain activity.\n\nQ4 2024 saw a significant surge in total value locked (TVL) across Ethereum and its Layer-2 networks, with Ethereum outperforming in relative growth. Ethereum continued to dominate TVL across all networks in 2024, consistently holding over 50% of all TVL throughout the year. Ethereum\u2019s TVL increased 36% QoQ, rising from $48.7 billion to $66.3 billion. Ethereum\u2019s TVL increase was even more significant YoY, surging 121.6% from $29.9 billion to $66.3 billion. Meanwhile, the combined TVL of all Layer-2s also experienced notable growth, climbing 18.8% QoQ from $8.4 billion to $10.1 billion, and 133.3% YoY.\n\nWhile Layer-2 TVL has historically grown at a faster rate relative to Ethereum, this trend saw a slight reversal in Q4. The proportion of Layer-2 TVL relative to Ethereum\u2019s TVL declined from 17.4% to 15.2% QoQ, reflecting the L1\u2019s stronger performance during the quarter.\n\nDeFi TVL on Ethereum experienced steady growth throughout the year, with TVL (ETH) increasing 56.6% YoY and TVL (USD) up 121.6%. In Q4\u201924, DeFi TVL (ETH) saw a modest 6.4% increase, rising from 18.7 million to 19.9 million. However, ETH\u2019s strong price performance over the quarter amplified DeFi TVL (USD), which climbed 36.1% from $48.7 billion to $66.3 billion.\n\nDeFi TVL peaked for the quarter on Dec. 7, 2024, reaching a high of $78 billion, underscoring the impact of both increased ETH valuation and sustained capital inflows into the ecosystem.\n\nMany of Ethereum\u2019s largest protocols experienced significant TVL growth in Q4 2024. Leading the surge was <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/ethena-the-goddess-of-yield\">Ethena</a>, a protocol that enables users to earn yield on USDe through delta-neutral hedging strategies. Ethena\u2019s TVL skyrocketed 134.1% QoQ, rising from $2.5 billion to $5.9 billion. Aave also saw substantial growth, with its TVL increasing 60.8% QoQ. Meanwhile, Lido, Ethereum\u2019s TVL leader, posted more moderate gains, expanding 24.5% from $26.1 billion to $32.5 billion.\n\nWhile price appreciation of deposited assets contributed to the overall increase in TVL, the sharp growth seen in protocols like Ethena and Aave reflects a clear rise in demand for yield-generating products.\n\nHistorically, our methodology has excluded certain liquid staking protocols and protocols that deposit into other protocols to avoid double counting assets. However, for this section, we have chosen to include all protocol TVLs, as the rapid ascent of protocols like Ethena provides valuable insight into evolving user priorities.\n\nLayer-2 Activity\n\nThe competition for TVL among Layer-2 networks remains intense, with new entrants emerging each quarter and mercenary capital moving from chain to chain. Taiko, an Ethereum-based rollup launched in May 2024, saw remarkable growth in Q4, expanding its TVL from $9.1 million to $371.3 million, a 3964.1% increase. Meanwhile, the most established L2s continued to see TVL growth, with Base leading the pack, surging 66.5% QoQ, followed by Arbitrum with a 20.1% increase and Optimism up 11.2%.In contrast, Blast continued to lose TVL and market share, declining 39.3% QoQ from $757.8 million to $460.1 million.\n\nNotably, Ethereum outperformed all major L2s in TVL growth aside from Base\u2014a trend worth monitoring as it challenges the prevailing narrative t hat Layer-2s are \u201cparasitic\u201d to Ethereum.\n\nEcosystem Overview\n\nDecentralized Exchanges\n\nTotal daily DEX volume (USD) on Ethereum surged 126.6% QoQ, rising from $1.1 billion in Q3 to $2.6 billion in Q4. Uniswap remained the dominant DEX on Ethereum, with V3 averaging $1.4 billion in daily volume, while V2 maintained a daily average of $214.4 million. Together, Uniswap V3 and V2 accounted for 80.3% of all Ethereum DEX volume throughout the quarter.\n\nAmong major DEXs, Maverick V2 posted the most growth, skyrocketing 922% QoQ from $5.5 million to $56.5 million in average daily volume. Conversely, PancakeSwap was the only large DEX to experience a decline, with average daily volume dropping 62.9% from $220.6 million to $81.8 million.\n\nThe overall rise in DEX volume reflects increased demand for token-related onchain activity, underscoring growing engagement with decentralized trading platforms.\n\nStablecoins\n\nEthereum\u2019s stablecoin supply expanded steadily throughout 2024, driven by a growing institutional interest in moving funds and real-world assets (RWAs) onchain. Total stablecoin market cap surged 65.6% YoY, rising from $66.9 billion to $110.8 billion, accounting for more than half of the total $210.5 billion stablecoin supply across all networks.\n\nOne of the most notable new entrants to the stablecoin space was <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/ethena-the-goddess-of-yield\">Ethena\u2019s USDe</a>, which launched in December 2023 and closed out 2024 with a market cap of $5.7 billion. Centralized stablecoins USDT and USDC also posted strong growth, increasing 72.7% and 45.3% YoY, respectively.\n\nQ4\u201924 saw particularly strong stablecoin expansion, with USDT increasing 38.6%from $46.7 billion to $64.7 billion, while USDC grew 18.2% from $24.4 billion to $28.9 billion. USDe continued to lead in growth, surging 136.2% from $2.4 billion to $5.7 billion, reflecting the increasing demand for onchain yield-bearing stablecoins.\n\nDespite USDe\u2019s rapid growth and USDC\u2019s steady expansion, USDT dominance increased in 2024, rising from 55.9% to 58.3% of Ethereum\u2019s total stablecoin supply. Tether, the issuer of USDT, reported over $13 billion in net profits for 2024, reinforcing its position as the dominant stablecoin provider in the market.\n\nPrague-Electra (Pectra) Upgrade\n\nThe last few upgrades have delivered massive improvements for Ethereum. The transition to Proof-of-Stake in <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-ethereum-q3-2022\">The Merge</a>, staking withdrawals in <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/staking-since-shapella\">Shapella</a>, and blobs in <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/analyzing-eip-4844-is-it-enough\">Dencun</a> significantly improved Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals while also growing the network. The next planned upgrade is called the <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/74adf70c-2590-4d5a-8c82-327b113836b1\">Prague and Electra upgrade</a>, or Pectra for short.\n\nFollowing All Core Devs Update 017, the final scope of the Pectra hard fork was confirmed, detailing the specific Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) set for inclusion. The finalized scope of Pectra consists of the <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/74adf70c-2590-4d5a-8c82-327b113836b1\">following</a> EIPs:\n\nEIP-7702: Set EOA Account Code  \nThis proposal allows externally owned accounts (EOAs) to adopt the code of existing smart contracts, enabling features like transaction bundling and gasless transactions. It represents a step towards account abstraction, improving user experience and security.  \n\nEIP-7251: Increase the MAXEFFECTIVEBALANCE  \nThis EIP raises the maximum effective balance for validators from 32 ETH to 2048 ETH, allowing validators to stake and earn rewards on any amount above the minimum. This change simplifies operations for stakers managing multiple validators and reduces network overhead.  \n\nEIP-7691: Blob Throughput Increase  \nBuilding upon the previous introduction of blobs for efficient Layer 2 rollup data storage, this proposal aims to increase blob throughput. The enhancement addresses the growing demand from Layer-2 solutions, aiming to reduce rollup fees and improve scalability.  \n\nEIP-6110: Supply Validator Deposits On-Chain  \nThis proposal introduces a mechanism to supply validator deposits directly onchain, streamlining the staking process and enhancing transparency in validator operations.  \n\nEIP-7002: Execution Layer Triggerable Exits  \nThis EIP enables validators to initiate exits from the execution layer, providing greater flexibility and control over staking positions.  \n\nEIP-7623: Increase Calldata Cost  \nTo address network congestion and optimize resource usage, this proposal suggests increasing the gas cost associated with calldata, encouraging more efficient data transmission practices.  \n\nEIP-7685: General Purpose Execution Layer Requests  \nThis EIP introduces a standardized method for the consensus layer to make requests to the execution layer, facilitating improved coordination and functionality between the two layers.  \n\nEIP-2537: Precompile for BLS12-381 Curve Operations  \nThis proposal adds a precompiled contract for BLS12-381 curve operations, enhancing the efficiency of cryptographic functions essential for various applications, including those in Layer 2 solutions.  \n\nEIP-2935: Save Historical Block Hashes in State  \nThis EIP proposes storing historical block hashes within the state, improving the accessibility and verification of past blockchain data for smart contracts and other applications.  \n\nEIP-7549: Move Committee Index Outside Attestation  \nThis proposal suggests relocating the committee index from within attestations to an external position, aiming to streamline the attestation process and reduce complexity in consensus operations.  \n\nEIP-7840: Add Blob Schedule to EL Config Files  \nThis EIP aims to incorporate the blob schedule into execution layer configuration files, ensuring better synchronization and planning for blob-related operations between the consensus and execution layers.\n\nOn Feb. 24, 2025, the Holesky testnet successfully upgraded to Pectra, marking a significant milestone in Ethereum\u2019s ongoing development. However, shortly after the upgrade, Holesky encountered a finality bug at block height 3,419,723, affecting specific Execution Layer (EL) clients. The issue was swiftly diagnosed and resolved, with Ethereum core developer Parithosh providing details on the fix.\n\nThe root cause of the issue stemmed from EIP-6110, which migrated the deposit detection mechanism from the Consensus Layer (CL) to the EL. This change introduced new configuration values via system contracts, but the required reconfiguration of the deposit contract had not been applied. Since Holesky and other development networks were merged at Ethereum\u2019s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) genesis, the absence of the updated deposit contract address led to configuration mismatches, ultimately causing finalization failures on certain EL clients.\n\nThe next All Core Devs call, scheduled for Feb. 27, 2025, will finalize the fork time for the Sepolia testnet and review the roadmap for mainnet deployment, setting the stage for Pectra\u2019s broader rollout. A full timeline of all things Pectra can be found <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/74adf70c-2590-4d5a-8c82-327b113836b1\">here</a>. \n\nClosing Summary\n\nEthereum's growth throughout Q4 2024 was marked by strong performance across multiple key metrics, highlighting its continued dominance. ETH's price appreciation of 32.7% QoQ and a 121.6% YoY increase in TVL (USD) underscore the increasing demand for Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure and applications. While ETH underperformed relative to BTC over the year, it remains the foundation for DeFi, stablecoins, and Layer-2s, solidifying its position as the leading smart contract platform.\n\nThe Ethereum staking landscape saw its first-ever quarterly decline in total staked ETH, with the staking ratio decreasing to 28.4% by year-end. However, the potential integration of staking within ETH ETFs in 2025 could be a game-changer, providing new institutional demand for staking participation. Developments such as Grayscale's proposal to incorporate staking into its Ethereum Trust ETFs and Cboe\u2019s filing for the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF suggest a shifting regulatory landscape that may further accelerate Ethereum\u2019s staking adoption.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Layer-2 ecosystem remains highly competitive, with Base leading in TVL growth and Taiko emerging as a notable new entrant. While Ethereum outperformed all major L2s except Base in Q4 TVL growth, the ongoing battle for capital allocation across networks highlights the growing importance of efficient scaling solutions. At the same time, the DEX market rebounded significantly, with 126.6% QoQ growth in total volume, driven by increased demand for onchain tokens.\n\nThe Pectra upgrade, Ethereum\u2019s next major network improvement, introduces key EIPs aimed at scalability, staking efficiency, and transaction cost optimization. While the Holesky testnet successfully implemented the upgrade, it faced a temporary finality bug linked to EIP-6110, which was quickly resolved. The Feb. 27, 2025, All Core Devs call will determine the timeline for Sepolia\u2019s upgrade and mainnet deployment, paving the way for Ethereum\u2019s next evolution.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, Ethereum\u2019s position remains strong as it continues to attract institutional capital, expand Layer-2 solutions, and refine its staking mechanisms. The potential for staking integration into ETH ETFs, coupled with advancements in scalability, will be key catalysts shaping Ethereum\u2019s trajectory in the coming year.", "published_on": "2025-03-11T11:00:00Z", "url": "https://messari.io/article/state-of-ethereum-q4-2024", "source": "Messari", "author": "Drexel Bakker", "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.12709577672711322, "subjectivity": 0.48875371556247105, "sentiment": "positive"}, "entities": ["bitcoin", "ethereum", "uniswap"], "topics": ["billion", "layer", "ethereums", "growth"]}, {"id": "aba4069c-0e02-41c4-882d-642ec643af4a", "title": "State of Pyth Q4 2024", "body": "Key Insights\n\nTotal Transaction Value (TTV) increased 459.1% YoY, rising from $31.3 billion in Q4\u201923 to $175.2 billion in Q4\u201924, reinforcing Pyth\u2019s position as the dominant oracle by transaction volume.\nTotal price updates grew 67.5% YoY, reaching 336.2 million updates, up from 200.7 million in Q4\u201923.

It also launched real-time oil price feeds, becoming the first oracle to support oil as commodities.\nPyth expanded institutional accessibility with the launch of the VanEck Pyth ETN and the 21Shares Pyth ETP, providing European investors with regulated exposure to the PYTH token through traditional financial products.\n\nIntroduction\n\nPyth (<a href=\"https://messari.io/project/pyth-network\">PYTH</a>) is an oracle network that aims to offer accurate prices for cryptocurrencies, equities, foreign exchange pairs, ETFs, and commodities. Oracle networks aggregate external data and make it available for onchain application use. Pyth fosters a network of first-party (primary source and aggregator) data providers and coordinates a \u201cpull\u201d oracle model. This model scales price feeds across many chains and lowers network costs by offloading update fees to data consumers (applications and developers). Pyth offers four core products:\n\nPrice Feeds (live updates for smart contracts)\nBenchmarks (historical market data)\nExpress Relay (priority auction to eliminate MEV)\nPyth Entropy (secure random number generator)  \n\nThe integrity of Pyth\u2019s data is dependent on its contributing publisher network, which comprises over 110 data providers from global exchanges, trading firms, market makers, institutions, and DeFi. A few notable providers include Jane Street, Cboe Global Markets, Binance, Raydium, Osmosis, Galaxy, and 0x. Pyth is focused on making financial market data available to developers on an expanding list of blockchain networks (97+ chains as of writing). For a full primer on Pyth, refer to our <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/understanding-pyth-network-a-comprehensive-overview\">Initiation of Coverage report</a>.\n\nWebsite / X (Twitter) / Discord\n\nKey Metrics\n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nTotal Transaction Value (TTV): \n\nTotal Transaction Volume (TTV) provides a more precise measure of an oracle\u2019s activity by capturing the actual transaction volume it enables rather than just the value of secured assets. Unlike Total Value Secured (TVS), which reflects static asset value, TTV highlights the frequency and scale of transactions relying on an oracle\u2019s data\u2014making it particularly relevant for high-frequency DeFi applications like DEXs and derivatives platforms. By tracking the total volume facilitated across integrated protocols, TTV offers a clearer picture of oracle demand, market share, and revenue potential in the evolving DeFi landscape.\n\nTotal Transaction Value (TTV) in Q4'24 reached $175.2 billion, reflecting a 5.2% increase from $166.5 billion in Q3'24. Year-over-year, TTV saw a 459.1% surge, rising from $31.3 billion in Q4'23. This continued expansion highlights the increasing reliance on Pyth\u2019s oracle services for transaction-intensive DeFi applications. As TTV remains a relatively new metric, it will continue to be evaluated to track long-term trends in oracle activity and market adoption.\n\nTTV vs. TVS\n\nWith Q4'24 marking the second quarter of reporting Total Transaction Value (TTV), its role as a key metric in evaluating oracle activity is becoming clearer. At the same time, Total Value Secured (TVS) remains an important measure of the sector\u2019s overall stability. Moving forward, TTV and TVS will continue to be assessed quarterly, offering insights into both transaction volume and the value secured by top oracles. As TTV gains wider industry adoption, TVS will still provide valuable context for tracking the broader oracle market. Given Pyth\u2019s high-frequency transaction model, TTV remains particularly relevant in capturing its real-time usage and network demand.\n\nIn Q4'24, Pyth maintained its lead in TTV, growing 5.2% QoQ from $166.5 billion to $175.2 billion, securing 41.0% of the total market share despite a 6.7 percentage point decline from Q3. Stork followed in second place, experiencing a 46.8% increase in TTV from $75.0 billion to $110.1 billion, strengthening its market position. Meanwhile, Edge recorded the largest quarterly TTV growth, surging 100.3% to $81.1 billion, overtaking Chainlink, which saw its TTV decline 8.5% from $66.4 billion to $60.8 billion. TWAP, a smaller oracle provider, faced the steepest drop, with TTV declining 91.5% QoQ from $757.9 million to $64.7 million.\n\nWhile TTV reflects Pyth\u2019s dominance in transaction volume, TVS remains stable, with Pyth increasing its TVS by 41.2% QoQ to $7.3 billion, reinforcing its position in the top three among oracles by secured asset value. Chainlink led the TVS market, growing 40.2% to $36.7 billion, while Chronicle and RedStone saw TVS increases of 29.2% and 49.5%, respectively. In contrast, WINkLink\u2019s TVS declined 11.6%, marking the only major decrease among top oracles.\n\nOverall, these shifts highlight diverging trends in the oracle space\u2014TTV-heavy oracles like Pyth and Edge prioritize transaction-driven applications, while Chainlink continues to dominate in TVS, securing high-value assets. The oracle market is becoming increasingly specialized, with protocols carving out distinct niches in data provisioning across DeFi, derivatives, and traditional finance integrations.\n\nPrice Updates\n\nAs a pull oracle, Pyth\u2019s demand is reflected by the volume of price updates it provides. In Pyth-secured applications, DeFi users initiate smart contract calls that simultaneously request the latest Pyth price data within the same transaction. This means that each time a DeFi protocol requires updated price information, a call is made to Pyth, and the oracle publishes a real-time price update directly within the transaction.\n\nPyth oracle demand continued to rise in Q4'24, with total price updates increasing 14.04% QoQ, reaching 336.2 million updates, up from 294.8 million in Q3'24. Sui Mainnet remained the largest contributor, growing 13.2% to 183.7 million updates, while Aptos Mainnet saw a 22.2% increase, reaching 128.5 million updates. Solana experienced a 16.6% decline, dropping to 19.4 million updates, while Arbitrum decreased by 23.5%, totaling 1.56 million updates. Other Chains saw a 54.8% increase, rising to 3.02 million updates.\n\nIn terms of overall update distribution, Sui Mainnet accounted for 54.6%, followed by Aptos at 38.2% and Solana at 5.8%. Arbitrum and Other Chains contributed 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively. These trends reflect continued demand for Pyth\u2019s price feeds, with variations across chains highlighting shifts in network activity and integration patterns.\n\nIn Q3\u201924, the Pyth Network experienced a shift in the composition of its price update transactions on Solana, with notable changes across sponsored, non-sponsored, and atomic updates. Sponsored updates (calculated as the sum of quarterly updates) took the lead in Q4\u201924, growing from 7.7 million updates in Q3\u201924 to 12.38 million in Q4\u201924, increasing by 60.78%. Sponsored updates are those executed at regular intervals using the Pyth Scheduler, a permissionless off-chain application that ensures continuous price updates for applications requiring consistent data refreshes. These updates are fully verified by 13 Wormhole Guardian signatures, ensuring high levels of security and reliability.\n\nDespite being the fastest-growing transaction type in Q3'24, atomic updates saw a significant decline in Q4'24, dropping from 7.7 million transactions to just 28,242\u2014a 99.6% decrease quarter-over-quarter. While atomic updates had previously gained traction due to their efficiency and partial verification mechanism, this sharp reduction suggests a shift in application preferences or network usage patterns in Q4'24.\n\nNon-sponsored updates, which grew significantly in Q3'24, saw a moderate decline in Q4'24, dropping from 6.8 million to 6,2 millions\u2014a 8.1% decrease quarter-over-quarter. These manually triggered smart contract calls, which bypass the Scheduler, remain widely used but appear to be consolidating as applications shift toward sponsored updates. This transition suggests an increasing preference for automated and cost-efficient data retrieval mechanisms.\n\nPyth\u2019s EVM-compatible integrations showed divergent trends in Q4'24, with Base leading in growth, while Arbitrum and Blast saw declines. Base price updates surged 102% QoQ, rising from 659,315 in Q3'24 to 1.3 million in Q4'24, reflecting its expanding role in Pyth\u2019s network. Conversely, Arbitrum price updates fell 23.4%, decreasing from 2.03 million to 1.56 million, marking a shift in update distribution. Blast recorded the largest decline, dropping 40.3%, from 490,415 to 292,836.\n\nCronos entered the top five EVM chains this quarter, replacing zkSync, with a 30.6% increase, reaching 285,513 updates. Other EVM chains collectively grew by 46.7%, from 757,069 to 1.11 million updates, indicating shifting usage patterns across the ecosystem.\n\nEntropy\n\nPyth Entropy offers developers a secure way to generate random numbers on the blockchain, leveraging two-party randomness to ensure trustworthy outcomes. This randomness solution supports applications requiring unpredictability, such as NFT mints, gaming, and consensus mechanisms. \n\nPyth Entropy's availability has grown QoQ; it is now accessible on 17 EVM networks, up from 16 in Q3\u201924. In Q4'24, Pyth processed 279,742 requests, generating $13,646 in revenue, marking a 98.4% increase in requests and a 97.7% rise in revenue from Q3'24\u2019s 141,000 requests and $6,900 revenue. While still in its early stages, this third consecutive quarter of data suggests that request volume and revenue are beginning to stabilize. If this trend of steady growth continues, it could indicate long-term sustainability and adoption of Pyth\u2019s pricing model.\n\nUser Costs (EVM)\n\nWhile the cost of pulling a Pyth update is minimal, users are still responsible for the gas fees associated with their DeFi transactions. These gas costs apply solely to users, with no expense incurred by Pyth.\n\nThe upward trend in gas costs following the Dencun/EIP-4844 upgrade persisted in Q4'24, with overall costs nearing pre-upgrade levels. Arbitrum maintained the lead, with gas costs increasing 99.1%, from $1.2 million to $2.4 million. Meanwhile, Optimism saw a 33.9% decline, dropping from $133,157 to $88,026, suggesting lower costs despite continued network activity. BNB Chain experienced the largest percentage growth, surging 415.7%, from 23,102 to 119,139, marking the most significant increase among all chains. Base also saw a 50.7% rise, with costs growing from 69,782 to 105,164, indicating sustained expansion in oracle integrations.\n\nExpress Relay on Solana (Kamino Usage)\n\nLaunched in Q3'24, Express Relay addresses Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) in DeFi by using isolated priority auctions to determine transaction priority off-chain, reducing MEV-related costs and improving efficiency. This mechanism allows searchers to bid for sequencing rights, ensuring transactions are processed more effectively without inflating costs for end-users.\n\nIn Q4'24, Kamino Finance integrated Express Relay to power Kamino Swap on Solana, enabling limit orders with plans to add market orders. This setup eliminates MEV, slippage, and extra fees by having searchers compete to fill orders at the best price while providing SOL tips directly to users. The integration highlights Pyth's infrastructure capabilities in delivering efficient, CEX-like execution on-chain, making DeFi more competitive without sacrificing decentralization.\n\nSolana Transaction Share\n\nIn Q4'24, Pyth\u2019s share of Solana transactions declined further from 3.09% in Q3'24 to 0.24%, reflecting the near-complete transition from a push oracle model to an on-demand pull oracle. Previously, under the push model, Pyth\u2019s transactions accounted for a significant portion of Solana\u2019s total activity, reaching as high as 48% to 60% on certain days. However, with updates now published only as needed by applications, transaction volume has stabilized at significantly lower levels.\n\nAs anticipated, this metric has become less relevant in assessing Pyth\u2019s growth and adoption, and this will be the final report that includes Solana transaction share. Future updates will focus on more representative metrics, such as Total Transaction Value (TTV) and price update volume, which better capture Pyth\u2019s activity and network demand.\n\nOracle Integrity Staking (OIS)\n\nOracle Integrity Staking (OIS) was introduced on Sept. 21, 2024, as a key addition to Pyth Network\u2019s staking framework, designed to enhance data reliability through economic incentives. OIS enables participants to stake PYTH tokens toward specific data publishers, aligning financial incentives with price accuracy. Stakers allocate their tokens to publishers, who are rewarded for providing high-quality data and penalized for inaccuracies. This model ensures that all current and future Pyth price feeds are secured by an incentive-driven mechanism, reinforcing the integrity of oracle data.\n\nIn Q4'24, total PYTH staked in OIS grew 70.8% QoQ, rising from $135.2 million in Q3'24 to $230.9 million. This increase reflects continued adoption and participation in OIS, with more users engaging in staking as a means to support data accuracy while earning rewards.\n\nQualitative Analysis\n\nProtocol Updates\n\nIntroducing Redemption Rate Feeds (RRF)\n\nIn Q3'24, Pyth Network introduced Express Relay, a protocol enhancement designed to reduce latency in delivering real-time data to blockchain platforms. Express Relay laid the foundation for subsequent advancements, including the announcement of Redemption Rate Feeds (RRF) on Oct. 27, 2024.\n\nRRF addresses a growing demand in decentralized finance (DeFi) for accurate data related to liquid staking tokens (LST), liquid restaking tokens (LRT), and yield-bearing stablecoins. These feeds enhance market efficiency and transparency for increasingly prominent financial instruments in the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThe initial rollout included 19 redemption rate feeds, such as CDCETH and USDY, which expanded rapidly to 28 feeds shortly after launch. This quick expansion demonstrates Pyth's adaptability to evolving market requirements. Key integrations include leading DeFi platforms such as:\n\nIonic Protocol\nZeroLend\nUniDex Finance\nPolynomial Protocol\n\nThese integrations highlight the adoption of RRF by platforms focused on diverse DeFi use cases, including lending, trading, and yield optimization.\n\nKamino Swap Integrates Pyth\u2019s Express Relay\n\nOn December 5th, Kamino Finance launched Kamino Swap, leveraging Pyth\u2019s Express Relay to power a high-performance, on-chain trading platform on Solana. Express Relay serves as the backend auction system, where searchers\u2014including major firms like Amber Group, Auros, Flowdesk, and Wintermute\u2014compete to fill user swap orders at the best price, eliminating MEV, slippage, and unnecessary fees.\n\nKamino Swap is designed to provide CEX-like execution within a decentralized framework. By integrating Express  Relay, the platform enables traders to access deep liquidity, enjoy fast, cost-efficient fills, and execute limit orders with pricing precision comparable to centralized exchanges. Market orders will also be introduced soon, further expanding Kamino\u2019s capabilities.\n\nHow It Works:\n\nToken Selection: Users pick their buy/sell tokens and set their preferred price.\nAuction-Based Execution: Searchers bid competitively to fill orders at the best possible price, ensuring users receive optimal execution.\nUser-Captured Value: Instead of MEV extractors profiting, searchers add a SOL tip that goes directly to users.\n\nKamino Swap\u2019s plug-and-play liquidity solution demonstrates how DeFi can compete directly with CeFi and TradFi, offering self-custody, transparency, and efficiency while eliminating the inefficiencies of traditional DEXs.\n\nAll metrics for Kamino Swap, including Total SOL Tips in notional as a USD equivalent, orders by day, and volume by day in USD, are based on data collected from December 5th, the day of Kamino Swap's launch, through the end of Q4'24.\n\nIn this context, tips refer to the SOL amounts that searchers pay as incentives during the auction process on Express Relay for the right to execute user limit orders. These tips are directed back to users, effectively enhancing the value received per trade by offsetting MEV and slippage that would typically be extracted by other market participants. By analyzing these metrics, we aim to assess Kamino's growth trajectory, user adoption, and its overall impact on Pyth's transaction volume and liquidity efficiency.\n\nGiven that these are new metrics introduced this quarter, they are included in the qualitative section of this report. However, in the coming quarters, these metrics will be presented in a dedicated section within the quantitative portion of the report to provide a more detailed and data-driven analysis of Kamino Swap's performance.\n\nSince its launch on December 5th, Kamino Swap has accumulated a total of $9,951.25 in SOL tips and processed $18.5 million in transaction volume across 16,982 orders. These figures highlight a promising start for Kamino Swap, demonstrating the utility of Pyth's Express Relay in facilitating high-frequency trading with reduced MEV and improved execution efficiency.\n\nInterestingly, the data suggests no clear correlation between the number of orders executed and the total volume traded. For instance, some days with fewer orders saw higher total volumes, while other days with a greater number of orders contributed less significantly to the overall volume. This pattern indicates that the average trade size varies considerably, likely influenced by the nature of assets traded and user behavior on the platform. As Kamino Swap continues to evolve, further data will be essential to understanding these dynamics and optimizing the use of Pyth\u2019s Express Relay.\n\nPerpetual Futures and Derivatives\n\nPyth Network's real-time price feeds continue to enable the development of sophisticated financial instruments across multiple blockchain ecosystems. These accurate and high-speed data feeds are integral to platforms offering derivatives and complex DeFi products. \n\nSome new introductions in Q4\u201924 include:\n\nSynthetix Integration: Synthetix utilized Pyth's oracle services to launch Multi-collateral Perpetual Futures (Perps) on Arbitrum. This integration supports diverse collateral options and enhances risk management for derivatives trading.\nKamino Finance on Solana: Kamino Finance introduced institutional-grade limit orders on Solana, leveraging Pyth's Express Relay for precise and efficient trading execution on decentralized exchanges.\nSynonym Finance's Multi-Ecosystem Lending Platform: Synonym Finance launched a cross-chain lending platform, integrating Pyth Network alongside Wormhole, Arbitrum, and Solana. This platform enables lending and borrowing across multiple blockchains, increasing flexibility and interoperability in decentralized lending.\n\nGovernance\n\nThe <a href=\"https://messari.io/project/pyth-network\">PYTH token</a> is an SPL token on Solana. The core utility of PYTH is governance. PYTH holders can guide protocol development by staking the asset and voting on Pyth Improvement Proposals (PIPs). Pyth DAO also consists of the Pythian Council and the Price Feed Council. Both councils are responsible for voting for and implementing certain operational PIPs.\n\nPyth DAO has two types of PIPs: Constitutional and Operational. Constitutional PIPs involve protocol updates, determining structure, and guiding the administration of the Pyth DAO. They require greater than 67% support for implementation. Operational PIPs involve elections and the management of the treasury, Pythian Council, and Price Feed Council. Voting on these PIPs can be delegated to Council members and require greater than 50% support for implementation.  \n  \nPIPs\n\nThroughout Q4, Pyth did not approve any new Constitutional PIPs despite two being suggested. On the other hand, 13  Operational PIPs were approved, reflecting its continued governance activity on Solana. The relevant proposals are listed below, showcasing the ongoing development and improvements within the Pyth ecosystem.  \n\nOperational:\n\nOP-PIP29: This proposal delegates 100,000 PGAS to 10 new Pythnet validators to enhance reliability and decentralization. Each validator is operated by a dedicated publisher, ensuring alignment between validator roles and publisher responsibilities. This builds on the framework established in OP-PIP-20.\nOP-PIP30: This proposal discontinues the operations of 10 Pythnet validator nodes, reallocating their delegated stake to other validators.

Operators rely on fragmented networks, outdated pricing models, and expensive 5G rollouts, which limit innovation and accessibility. Meanwhile, large tech companies have created data monopolies by developing their own ecosystems, further restricting access to high-quality user data essential for the next generation of AI applications.\n\nRoam addresses these structural challenges by combining decentralized wireless infrastructure with tokenization. Through its global WiFi OpenRoaming network, Roam offers automatic, secure connectivity across millions of access points, replacing manual logins with blockchain-based authentication using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). \n\nBy incentivizing users to expand and maintain the network, Roam has built one of the largest <a href=\"https://messari.io/copilot/share/understanding-depin-b6513a87-9754-46f8-9508-f4b9b7396d6f\">Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs)</a> globally. Users earn Roam Points for upgrading WiFi hotspots, sharing CDN bandwidth, and facilitating seamless roaming. These points can be redeemed for Roam tokens, aligning user incentives with network growth.\n\nRoam\u2019s infrastructure also serves as a critical data layer for AI, enabling privacy-preserving access to real-world behavioral data. Its integration of blockchain and telecommunications technologies offers secure data sharing across devices, enhancing AI training datasets while preserving user privacy.\n\nTeam\n\nRoam\u2019s leadership team is a mix of doxxed and anonymous contributors:\n\nCo-founder @alphacurve is an anon who is sporadically active on X and frequently posts about Roam.\nCo-founder Jeffrey Manner brings venture and crypto experience. In addition to his role at Roam, Jeffrey is a General Partner at Weave VC, a Canada-based venture firm focused on early-stage investments. \nRoam\u2019s Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) is Rohan, who is active on X with 4,500 followers. Rohan regularly promotes Roam\u2019s developments and helps drive community engagement.\n\nInvestors\n\nSource\n\nRoam has successfully raised capital through <a href=\"https://messari.io/project/metablox/fundraising\">several funding rounds</a>:\n\nGrant Funding (February 28th, 2022): Raised $250,000 with a grant from Harmony.\nSeed Funding (March 15th, 2022): Raised $2 million with investments from SNZ Holding, Collab+Currency, Synergis, NFT Technologies, Crowdcreate, and one additional investor.\nStrategic Funding (December 2023): Raised $5 million with Anagram Crypto and Volt Capital leading the round, joined by 11 additional investors including SNZ Holding, IoTeX, and Stratified Capital.\nUndisclosed Funding (April 21st, 2024): Raised an undisclosed amount with investment from Samsung Next.\n\nTechnology\n\nOpenRoaming Network Overview\n\nSource\n\nRoam\u2019s OpenRoaming network combines the Wireless Broadband Alliance\u2019s global WiFi roaming standard with crypto technology. It enables automatic, secure WiFi connections across millions of access points, removing the need for manual logins. Roam\u2019s decentralized authentication process uses blockchain nodes to verify user DIDs and VCs, ensuring self-sovereign user data management.\n\nDecentralized Authentication and Connection Process\n\nWhen joining the network, all users receive a DID, which serves as a secure, blockchain-verified identity. When users connect to a Roam hotspot, their DID and VC are validated by nodes, allowing seamless access. This process preserves privacy by keeping personal data off centralized servers.\n\nNetwork Infrastructure and Roam Miners\n\nSource\n\nRoam Miners are physical WiFi routers acting as access points and blockchain nodes. They validate user credentials, maintain decentralized governance, and earn Roam Points for each successful verification. Miners also support cloud mining through Roam\u2019s NFT system, where each MetaBlox Genesis NFT corresponds to a deployed miner. NFT holders earn Roam Points from their associated miner\u2019s activity and can stake NFTs for additional rewards.\n\nIncentive Model and Token Mechanics\n\nRoam Points are the core incentive mechanism, earned by users for connecting, maintaining, and expanding the network. Points can be converted into Roam tokens after TGE, aligning user and operator incentives with long-term network growth. Hosts earn additional rewards by upgrading hotspots and sharing CDN bandwidth.\n\nUsers earn Roam Points through several activities across both the Roam app and Roam Miners. Within the Roam app, adding a private WiFi network with a password earns 100 Points upfront, along with up to 12 daily Points based on the network's health, while adding a public WiFi network without a password earns 100 Points. Check-ins, where users validate network functionality, provide 10 Points per check-in, along with 1 sticker and 5 eSIM data credits. Referring friends to the Roam app also generates 30 Points per successful referral.\n\nRoam Miner hosts can earn significant Point rewards, starting with 3,000 Points upon successful registration. Active miners that operate normally receive 60 daily Points, while user check-ins at miner locations can generate up to 150 additional Points per day. \n\n5G Offloading and Network Efficiency\n\nRoam supports seamless 5G offloading, allowing mobile devices to shift data from cellular to WiFi, reducing cellular costs and improving coverage. This is particularly valuable in regions with limited 5G infrastructure.\n\nSecurity and Compliance\n\nRoam adheres to established security and performance standards, including:\n\nWBA OpenRoaming standards\n5G interoperability\nIEEE 802.11 EAP\nHotspot 2.0\nTrust-Over-IP (ToIP)\n\nData and AI Integration\n\nRoam\u2019s infrastructure serves as a privacy-preserving data layer for AI applications. By enabling secure, real-time access to behavioral data across millions of access points, Roam provides AI developers with high-quality, real-world datasets. This decentralized approach reduces data silos and enhances AI model training without compromising user privacy.\n\nTokenomics\n\nRoam Points and ROAM Overview\n\nRoam operates under a dual-token system consisting of Roam Points and the ROAM token. This structure is designed to balance user engagement, incentivize network growth, and provide long-term economic sustainability. The ROAM token TGEd on March 6, 2025. \n\nRoam Points function as the internal settlement currency within the Roam ecosystem. Points are earned through mining activities, network contributions, and user participation. They are directly linked to USDT/USDC value, providing a stable medium for internal transactions.\n\nThe utility for Roam Points includes:\n\nToken Generation: Points are burned to generate ROAM tokens after the TGE.\nService Payments: Points can be used to pay for in-app services like eSIM data packages, content creator compensation, and redeemable benefits (e.g., gift cards and discounts).\nAsset Enhancement: Points are used to merge and upgrade NFTs and stickers within the Roam ecosystem.\nCross-Project Exchange: Points can be swapped with those from other participating projects.\n\nROAM tokens are generated through a pre-defined emission curve, with a gradually decreasing emission rate managed through a difficulty adjustment algorithm. This mechanism aligns token supply with network activity and demand.\n\nThe demand drivers for ROAM include:\n\nRepurchase and Burn: Roam will use network revenue to repurchase and permanently burn ROAM tokens.\nStaking Rewards: Users can stake ROAM to earn income from Roam Growth products.\nDiscovery Product Access: Users can lock ROAM to participate in Roam Discovery products, gaining access to potential rewards and project incentives.\nPoint Conversion: Users can convert ROAM tokens into Points to access ecosystem services.\n\nROAM Supply and Distribution\n\nThe total supply of ROAM is capped at 1 billion, with no plans for additional issuance. Tokens are distributed according to the following allocations:\n\nTeam Allocation: 120 million (vesting over 6 years)\nInvestors and Airdrop: 280 million\nMining Emission: 600 million (distributed through post-TGE mining)\n\nAdditionally, Roam has a difficulty adjustment. Roam\u2019s difficulty adjustment mechanism dynamically controls token emissions based on network activity. As user check-ins and network usage increase or decrease, the system adjusts emission rates to maintain token stability, similar to Bitcoin\u2019s difficulty adjustment process.\n\nEconomic Flywheel\n\nRoam's economic sustainability is built around three core flywheels that align user incentives with network growth:\n\nUser Flywheel:\n  Attract users with Web3 incentives and OpenRoaming services.\n  Expand the user base through community-driven growth.\n  Lower eSIM data costs and increase advertising revenue, enhancing token value and further incentivizing user growth.\nNode Flywheel:\n  Incentivize deployment of WiFi miners.\n  Increase network coverage, driving higher user satisfaction.\n  Nodes generate cash flow from CDN and IP applications, supporting sustainable miner rewards.\nAI Data Flywheel (Future):\n  Collect privacy-protected, location-verified data.\n  Enhance datasets through Roam Discovery collaborations.\n  Enable AI agents and distributed models on Roam, generating new data and further driving network expansion.\n\nEcosystem and Partnerships Overview\n\nNetwork Data\n\nRoam's activity began accelerating in mid-2024, driven by increasing adoption of its decentralized WiFi infrastructure and user participation incentives. Since then, Roam has experienced steady growth across most key metrics, reflecting both user engagement and network expansion.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Roam has:\n\n2.4 million registered users\n186.5 million check-ins\n2.1 million active WiFi nodes\n219.6 million stickers issued\n\nRoam\u2019s global footprint continues to expand, with WiFi nodes deployed across nearly every major country and city worldwide. This wide distribution highlights Roam\u2019s progress toward becoming a truly global decentralized wireless network, with participation spanning both densely populated urban centers and underserved regions.\n\nEcosystem Projects\n\nRoam\u2019s partnerships extend across telecommunications, infrastructure, and other crypto verticals, bringing complementary technologies and expertise into the Roam ecosystem. By working with established industry players, emerging DePIN projects, and application developers, Roam accelerates both adoption and innovation within its network.\n\nNotable Roam Ecosystem Projects include:\n\nIoTeX: A modular Web3 infrastructure platform focused on connecting smart devices and real-world data to blockchains. By combining blockchain and IoT technologies, IoTeX enables DePIN projects to seamlessly connect and monetize physical infrastructure, including environmental sensors, smart devices, and location-based services.\nHuma Finance: An onchain credit platform in the PayFi (Payments + Finance) category. Huma Finance provides income-backed lending and receivable financing, leveraging real-world assets to expand DeFi access to businesses and individuals. \nPowerPod: A decentralized Internet of Energy project focused on building a community-driven EV charging network. PowerPod integrates IoT technology with blockchain, allowing participants to host charging stations and earn passive income. \n\nClosing Summary\n\nRoam is addressing fundamental challenges in the telecommunications industry by combining decentralized wireless infrastructure with tokenized incentives, creating a seamless and globally accessible connectivity network. Through its integration of OpenRoaming technology, blockchain-based authentication, and a dual-token system, Roam has built one of the largest DePINs to date.\n\nRoam\u2019s rapidly growing global footprint, with millions of active nodes, users, and check-ins, highlights both the market demand for decentralized connectivity and the effectiveness of its incentive model. By aligning user participation with long-term network growth through Roam Points and the ROAM token, Roam has created an economic flywheel that benefits individual users, infrastructure operators, and application developers alike.", "published_on": "2025-03-10T13:00:00Z", "url": "https://messari.io/article/understanding-roam-a-comprehensive-overview", "source": "Messari", "author": "Nicholas Garcia", "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.10718634760301422, "subjectivity": 0.38093070509737187, "sentiment": "positive"}, "entities": ["bitcoin"], "topics": ["roam", "user", "network", "point", "data"]}, {"id": "1271c527-cd07-4d27-ac7b-05bf2e4d587b", "title": "State of Babylon Q4 2024", "body": "Key Insights\n\nPhase-1 attracted cumulative deposits totaling 57,290 BTC, or 0.29% of Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply. Compared to Bitcoin ETFs, Babylon's protocol had accumulated the third-highest amount of Bitcoin, behind Blackrock and Fidelity.\nBy the end of 2024, 41,032 BTC had been liquid staked, an increase of 181.7% QoQ. Lombard continued to be Babylon\u2019s leading liquid staking protocol, ending Q4\u201924 with a TVL of 15,959 BTC, up 157.5% QoQ as LBTC became the 5th largest bitcoin derivative.\nBitcoin liquid staking protocols announced fundraises totaling over $24 million in Q4\u201924, with announcements from Solv, PumpBTC, Allo, and Lombard.\nBy the end of 2024, Babylon\u2019s top three Finality Providers by delegation amount were liquid staking protocols, accounting for 68.5% of total delegations. These protocols included Lombard, Solv, and PumpBTC.\nIn December 2024, Babylon Foundation launched a Delegation Program that will delegate stake toward Babylon Genesis validators. This will help diversify the active validator set once Babylon Genesis launches and Phase-2 commences.\n\nPrimer\n\n<a href=\"https://messari.io/project/babylon\">Babylon</a> was founded in 2022 by David Tse and Dr. Fisher Yu. Their original inspiration stemmed from a research paper on Bitcoin security co-authored with the founder of EigenLayer, Sreeram Kannan. Babylon plans to offer a security-sharing protocol.pdf) that leverages Bitcoin's security to secure Bitcoin Secured Networks (BSNs), such as Layer-1 proof-of-stake (PoS) networks, data availability (DA) protocols, and oracles. The protocol will be facilitated through a Layer-1 network (\u201cBabylon Genesis\u201d) on Cosmos.\n\nThrough Babylon, bitcoin tokenholders that desire yield can deposit (stake) bitcoins to provide security for BSNs, which will include Babylon Genesis itself. Staked bitcoins are delegated to Finality Providers (FPs), which will serve as the validators that secure BSNs. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s lack of smart contracts, Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language is used to engineer stake slashing to punish misbehaving FPs. For a full primer on Babylon, refer to our Initiation of Coverage <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/understanding-babylon-a-comprehensive-overview\">report</a>.\n\nBabylon\u2019s roadmap consists of three Phases. Phase-1 attracted bitcoin deposits but did not implement stake slashing. Phase-1 consisted of three capped deposit rounds and saw an ecosystem of liquid staking protocols emerge, including leaders like Lombard and Solv. Phase-2 will introduce stake slashing with the launch of Babylon Genesis as the first BSN secured by Babylon, and is planned for Q1 2025. Phase-3 will launch Babylon\u2019s full security sharing capabilities as other BSNs become secured by Babylon.\n\nBabylon has raised $96.8 million to fund its vision. In May 2023, Babylon raised $8.8 million in a seed round led by IDG and Breyer Capital. In December 2023, Babylon raised $18 million in a Series A led by Polychain Capital and Hack VC. In May 2024, Babylon raised $70 million in a Series B led by Paradigm. A full list of investments in Babylon can be found <a href=\"https://messari.io/project/babylon/fundraising/funding\">here</a>.\n\nWebsite / X / Discord / Telegram / Docs / GitHub / Forum\n\nPhase-1 Deposits\n\nLeading up to the launch of Babylon Genesis, Babylon has attracted bitcoin deposits through three capped deposit rounds across Phase-1. Throughout Phase-1, stakers and Finality Providers (FPs) have earned points at varying rates, which reflect each user\u2019s contribution to Babylon. Notably, Phase-1 did not implement stake slashing, which is planned to be activated in Phase-2 upon the launch of Babylon Genesis.\n\nDuring Phase-1, deposited bitcoins are considered to be staked. Stakes last a maximum of 64,000 Bitcoin blocks (~15 months), after which they are considered to be expired and can be withdrawn. Notably, depositors can elect to unbond their bitcoins at any time. After an unbonding period of 1,008 blocks (~seven days), the stake is considered to be expired and can be withdrawn. This process is manually performed by a Covenant Committee%20%E2%80%93%20Security%20auditor) that operates within a 6-of-9 multi-signature scheme that approves unbonding transactions.\n\nCap-1\n\nCap-1 launched on Aug. 22, 2024, with a staking capacity of 1,000 BTC. The round attracted 1,000 BTC from 12,720 unique addresses. An estimated 80% of deposits came from Babylon\u2019s ecosystem of liquid staking protocols, while the rest was natively staked.\n\nDuring Cap-1, users could deposit between 0.005 and 0.05 BTC per transaction. The round operated on a first-come-first-served (FCFS) basis, and was open for six Bitcoin blocks (~74 minutes) before reaching capacity. While the round was open for deposits, 3,125 points were distributed between stakers and FPs per Bitcoin block.\n\nCap-2\n\nCap-2 launched on Oct. 8, 2024. The round attracted 22,891 BTC from 12,590 unique addresses. This round did not feature a hard cap on deposits. Instead, it was duration-based, accepting deposits for 10 Bitcoin blocks (~two hours). Users could deposit between 0.005 and 500 BTC per transaction. While the round was open for deposits, 10,000 points were distributed between stakers and FPs per Bitcoin block, inclusive of stake from Cap-1.\n\nCap-3\n\nCap-3 launched on Dec. 10, 2024. The round attracted 33,399 BTC from 109,980 unique addresses. Once again, this round was duration-based, accepting deposits for 1,000 Bitcoin blocks (~seven days) until Dec. 17, 2024. Notably, an anonymous user deposited a total of 10,000 BTC, worth over $1 billion, across three transactions on Dec. 15, 2024.\n\nUsers could deposit between 0.005 and 5,000 BTC per transaction. For the first 300 Bitcoin blocks, 100,000 points were distributed between stakers and FPs per block, inclusive of stake from Cap-1 and Cap-2. For the final 700 Bitcoin blocks, points per block were reduced to 21,000.\n\nCap-3 also saw the following developments occur:\n\nCap-3 introduced Babyl\u00f3\u00f3ng, Babylon\u2019s dragon mascot. Users that natively staked at least 0.005 BTC during Cap-3 were eligible to receive special roles in Discord. A related contest is slated to run from Jan. 22, 2025, to March 17, 2025.\nOn Dec. 9, 2024, Binance introduced \u201cOn-chain Yields.\u201d The product\u2019s first offering allowed users to stake bitcoins with Babylon directly on Binance.\nOn Nov. 21, 2024, Anchorage Digital introduced support for bitcoin staking for institutions.\n\nBabylon versus ETFs\n\nBabylon\u2019s cumulative deposits (BTC) totaled 57,290 by the end Phase-1, worth $5.35 billion at the end of 2024. In total, Babylon\u2019s cumulative deposits equated to 0.29% of Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply at the end of 2024. Notably, cumulative deposits (BTC) do not reflect bitcoin withdrawals, which have reduced Babylon\u2019s TVL (BTC) marginally over time.\n\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) for bitcoin launched in January 2024. Assets under management (AUM) for these products increased throughout 2024, ending the year with a total AUM (BTC) of 938,635. As Babylon saw 57,290 BTC deposited throughout 2024, when compared to bitcoin ETFs, Babylon's protocol had accumulated the third-highest amount of Bitcoin, behind Blackrock and Fidelity.\n\nLiquid Staking Ecosystem\n\nA majority of Babylon\u2019s bitcoin deposits come from its ecosystem of liquid staking protocols. These protocols accept bitcoin deposits from users regardless of whether or not Babylon is accepting additional deposits. In return, users receive liquid staking tokens that can be used across DeFi. When Babylon opens deposits, protocol-held bitcoins are natively deposited (staked) with Babylon.\n\nBy the end of 2024, approximately 41,032 BTC had been liquid staked, an increase of 181.7% QoQ up from 14,567. Lombard continued to be Babylon\u2019s leading liquid staking protocol by a wide margin:\n\nLombard (LBTC): Ended Q4\u201924 with a TVL of 15,959 BTC, up 157.5% QoQ. This resulted in LBTC becoming the 5th largest bitcoin derivative behind WBTC, BTCB, cbBTC, and M-BTC.\n  Lombard\u2019s growth can be largely attributed to two things, its focus on DeFi integrations and the Luminary Program that rewards users with Lux points. Lombard offers products in partnership with Berachain, BOB, Corn, SatLayer, Pendle, Morpho, Maple Finance, Euler, and more, all of which distribute Lux points.\n  Lombard has led the emergence of restaked bitcoin, which is facilitated through Symbiotic and Karak. LBTC holders can mint liquid restaking tokens in partnership with Ether.Fi (eBTC).\n  In December 2024, Lombard raised $1 million from Binance Labs. This comes after a $16 million seed round in July 2024.\n  LBTC is natively supported on three networks. Over 93% of LBTC\u2019s supply lives on Ethereum, though a significant portion has been minted on Base, and a lesser amount on BNB Smart Chain.\nSolv (SolvBTC.BBN): Ended Q4\u201924 with a TVL of 9,360 BTC, up 112.4% QoQ.\n  Solv\u2019s growth can be largely attributed to its focus on DeFi integrations and its points program that rewards users with Solv points. Solv offers products in partnership with Avalon, Pendle, Mezo, SatLayer, Corn, Sonic, and more, all of which distribute Solv points.\n  Solv launched its SOLV token on Jan. 17, 2025, on Hyperliquid. The initial airdrop to Season 1 points holders totaled 7.25% of the total supply. Season 2 is now ongoing.\n  In December 2024, Solv raised $11 million in a strategic funding round, bringing its total amount raised to $25 million.\nPumpBTC (pumpBTC): Ended Q4\u201924 with a TVL of 5,498 BTC, up 245.3% QoQ.\n  PumpBTC\u2019s growth can be largely attributed to its focus on DeFi integrations and its points program that rewards users with PumpBTC points. PumpBTC offers products in partnership with Berachain, Corn, Core, Zircuit, Swell, Pendle, and more, all of which distribute PumpBTC points. Notably, the snapshot for Season 1 was completed on Jan. 1, 2025.\n  In December 2024, PumpBTC raised $10 million in a seed round.\n  In October 2024, PumpBTC launched its PumpBera NFT collection as a free mint on Arbitrum.\n  pumpBTC is natively supported on seven networks. Over 88% of pumpBTC\u2019s supply lives on Ethereum, though a significant portion has been minted on BNB Smart Chain and Base.\nObelisk (oBTC): Ended Q4\u201924 with a TVL of 3,583 BTC, up 35,654.2% QoQ.\n  Obelisk is operated by NodeDAO, a decentralized staking operator.\n\nOther bitcoin liquid staking protocols include Lorenzo (stBTC), Bedrock (uniBTC), Acorn (aBTC), BabyPie (mBTC), Allo (alloBTC), pSTAKE (yBTC), and Kinza (kBTC). Notably, Allo was the one project from this list that announced it had raised funds in Q4\u201924. It raised $2 million in a seed round and $750,000 in a Binance Labs accelerator program. In total, bitcoin liquid staking protocols announced fundraises totaling over $24 million in Q4\u201924.\n\nBabylon\u2019s liquid staking diversity score was six (i.e., the number of liquid staking protocols comprising 90% of Babylon\u2019s liquid staking TVL) at the end of 2024. This is a 50% QoQ increase, as Obelisk and Lorenzo joined Lombard, Solv, PumpBTC, and Bedrock. Acorn, BabyPie, Allo, and Kinza made up the remaining amount at the end of 2024, while pSTAKE didn\u2019t launch yBTC until Jan. 15, 2025.\n\nIn Q4 2024, quarterly net deposits (BTC) increased for the majority of Babylon\u2019s liquid staking protocols.\n\nLombard: 9,762 BTC deposited, up 57.5% QoQ as it maintained its lead in TVL and saw the highest net deposits among all bitcoin liquid staking protocols.\n  Lombard\u2019s largest daily net deposits totaled 1,057 BTC on Oct. 4, while its largest daily net withdrawals totaled 378 BTC on Nov. 23.\nSolv: 4,954 BTC deposited, up a modest 12.4% QoQ to remain Babylon\u2019s second largest liquid staking protocol by TVL.\n  Solv\u2019s largest daily net deposits totaled 1,170 BTC on Oct. 14, while its largest daily net withdrawals totaled 785 BTC on Dec. 17.\nPumpBTC: 3,906 BTC deposited, up 145.3% QoQ as PumpBTC jumped from 4th to 3rd place in terms of TVL across bitcoin liquid staking protocols.\n  PumpBTC\u2019s largest daily net deposits totaled 2,000 BTC on Dec. 17, while its largest daily net withdrawals totaled 700 BTC on Dec. 7.\nObelisk: 3,573 BTC deposited, up 8,695.5% QoQ as the protocol emerged to become Babylon\u2019s fourth largest liquid staking protocol by TVL.\n  Obelisk\u2019s largest daily net deposits occurred on Oct. 17 (1,050 BTC) and Oct. 29 (1,000 BTC).\nLorenzo: 1,442 bitcoins deposited, up 3,448.6% QoQ as the protocol emerged to become Babylon\u2019s fifth largest liquid staking protocol by TVL.\n  Lorenzo\u2019s Q4\u201924 net deposits originated largely from two consecutive days. Net deposits totaled 912 and 710 BTC on Oct. 8 and Oct. 10, respectively.\n\nFinality Providers\n\nBabylon attracted over 200 Finality Providers (FPs) that garnered delegations in 2024. By the end of the year, the top three FPs were liquid staking protocols that made up 68.5% of Babylon\u2019s total delegated bitcoins. Three of these protocols have garnered significantly more delegations than their own TVL, indicating confidence from users aside from the benefits that liquid staking tokens provide.\n\nLombard: Ended Q4\u201924 with a delegation (BTC) of 23,180 and a delegation dominance of 40.7%. As Babylon\u2019s largest liquid staking protocol by TVL, Lombard is also the FP with the most delegations.\n  Lombard\u2019s delegation (BTC) is 45.2% higher than its TVL (BTC) of 15,959, indicating a level of trust placed in the protocol by those that choose to native stake and forego minting LBTC.\nSolv: Ended Q4\u201924 with a delegation (BTC) of 10,240 and a delegation dominance of 18%.\n  Solv\u2019s delegation (BTC) is 32.7% higher than its TVL (BTC) of 7,714, indicating a level of trust placed in the protocol by those that choose to native stake and forego minting SolvBTC.BBN.\nPumpBTC: Ended Q4\u201924 with a delegation (BTC) of 5,597 and a delegation dominance of 9.8%.\n  PumpBTC\u2019s delegation (BTC) is only 1.8% higher than its TVL (BTC) of 5,498, indicating the vast majority of users prefer to mint pumpBTC to earn points and leverage it in DeFi.\n\nBabylon\u2019s Finality Provider diversity score was 13 (i.e., the number of Finality Providers receiving 90% of delegations) at the end of 2024. Real-time TVL data across Babylon, inclusive of all FPs and their delegation amounts, can be seen on the Babylon Staking Dashboard.\n\nBabylon Foundation Delegation Program\n\nIn December 2024, Babylon Foundation launched a Delegation Program. Babylon Foundation\u2019s Delegation Program will support validators that wish to secure Babylon Genesis upon its launch as Phase-2 commences. Babylon Foundation will delegate stake toward accepted validators, helping to diversify the active set which will comprise the top 100 validators by delegated stake.\n\nProspective validators were able to apply for delegation by Jan. 31, 2025. The duration of delegation will be six months, after which extensions can be requested for outstanding performers. Notably, validators that operate exclusively as liquid staking protocols, and any validators with delegations that exceed 10% of total delegated amount, are ineligible to join or remain in the program.\n\nBitcoin Secured Networks\n\nBabylon\u2019s network of Bitcoin Secured Networks (BSNs) continues to grow, reaching%2C%20networks%20who%20aim%20to%20leverage%20Bitcoin%E2%80%99s%20security%20using%20the%20Babylon%20Bitcoin%20staking%20protocol%2C%20that%20committed%20to%20integrating%20with%20Babylon.%20Notable%20BSNs%20like%20Corn%20and%20BOB%20committed%20to%20becoming%20BSNs%20when%20Phase%2D2%20launches%20(more%20on%20that%20below).) 25 in 2024. In Q4 2024, Babylon announced it will be investing in prospective BSNs, and introduced the following BSNs:\n\nIn December 2024, Babylon introduced BOB as a BSN. BOB is an Ethereum Layer-2 network focused on bitcoin-based DeFi with $220 million in TVL (USD) at the end of 2024. BOB\u2019s architecture also leverages BitVM to enable trust-minimized bridges that inherit security from Bitcoin and facilitate interoperability with other Layer-1 networks.\nIn December 2024, Babylon introduced Manta Network as a BSN. Manta is a general-purpose Ethereum Layer-2 network with $65 million in TVL (USD) at the end of 2024.\nIn December 2024, Babylon introduced BirdLayer (formerly DODOchain) as a BSN. Birdlayer is a trading-focused Arbitrum Layer-3 network with $23 million in TVL (USD) at the end of 2024.\nIn December 2024, Babylon introduced LayerEdge as a BSN. LayerEdge is a proof aggregation layer for Bitcoin, aiming to leverage Bitcoin to secure and verify complex computations without executing them directly.\nIn November 2024, Babylon introduced Sui as a BSN. Sui is a general-purpose Layer-1 network with $1.7 billion in TVL (USD) at the end of 2024. Sui is based on the MoveVM, whose core technical differentiation is the replacement of accounts with objects.\nIn November 2024, Babylon introduced Pell Network as a BSN. Pell Network is an omnichain restaking protocol with $385 million in TVL (USD) at the end of 2024. Pell Network allows liquid staked bitcoin to be restaked to secure Decentralized Validated Services (DVS).\nIn October 2024, Babylon introduced Corn as a BSN. Corn is an Ethereum Layer-2 network with $2 million in TVL (USD) at the end of 2024. Corn is focused on bitcoin-based DeFi and utilizes BTCN, a tokenized version of bitcoin, as the network\u2019s gas and rewards token.\nIn October 2024, Babylon introduced SatLayer as a BSN. SatLayer is an omnichain restaking protocol that allows liquid staked bitcoin to be restaked to secure Bitcoin Validated Services (BVS).\n\nClosing Summary\n\nIn Q4 2024, Babylon concluded Phase-1 after opening for bitcoin deposits during Cap-2 and Cap-3. In total, Phase-1 attracted cumulative deposits totaling 57,290 BTC, or 0.29% of Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply. Compared to bitcoin ETFs, Babylon's protocol had accumulated the third-highest amount of Bitcoin, behind Blackrock and Fidelity.\n\nThe majority of Babylon\u2019s bitcoin deposits came from its ecosystem of liquid staking protocols. bitcoin liquid staking protocols announced fundraises totaling over $24 million in Q4\u201924, with announcements coming from Solv, PumpBTC, Allo, and Lombard. By the end of 2024, 41,032 BTC had been liquid staked, an increase of 181.7% QoQ. Lombard continued to be Babylon\u2019s leading liquid staking protocol, ending 2024 with a TVL of 15,959 BTC, up 157.5% QoQ as LBTC became the 5th largest bitcoin derivative.\n\nBy the end of 2024, Babylon\u2019s top three Finality Providers by delegation amount were liquid staking protocols, accounting for 68.5% of total delegations. These protocols included Lombard, Solv, and PumpBTC. In December, Babylon Foundation launched a Delegation Program that will delegate stake toward Babylon Genesis validators. Users can look forward to the commencement of Phase-2 as Babylon Genesis launches and becomes the first Bitcoin Secured Network (BSN).", "published_on": "2025-03-10T12:00:00Z", "url": "https://messari.io/article/state-of-babylon-q4-2024", "source": "Messari", "author": "Patryk Krasnicki", "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.100171291538198, "subjectivity": 0.45346008907159996, "sentiment": "positive"}, "entities": ["bitcoin", "ethereum", "cosmos"], "topics": ["babylon", "protocol", "deposit", "liquid", "delegation"]}, {"id": "31deaaa9-9857-4dc5-b881-b54ae9e4a2dd", "title": "State of The Graph Q4 2024", "body": "Key Insights\n\nDemand for data on The Graph reached an all-time high of over 5.9 billion queries in Q4, up 13% QoQ from 5.3 billion. Additionally, demand-side fees in USD grew by 4.3% QoQ to an all-time high of $215,000.\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, there were more than 11,200 active Subgraphs on The Graph, an increase of 8% QoQ from 10,400.\nIn November, Geo, a core developer team for The Graph, proposed GRC-20, a knowledge graph standard that aims to establish a unified, interoperable data structure for decentralized applications in Web3.\nIndexing rewards increased 2% QoQ from $16.1 million to $16.5 million in USD, while in GRT terms they grew by an approximately equivalent amount of 1.8% QoQ to 77.5 million GRT.\nSince Q3\u201924, The Graph has integrated multiple networks, including Boba, Unichain, and Mantra, extending its support to more than 100+ chains.\n\nPrimer\n\nThe Graph (<a href=\"https://messari.io/project/the-graph\">GRT</a>) is an indexing protocol that provides onchain data \u2014 such as DeFi transactions and liquidity pool data \u2014 from various sources. The Graph removes the need for data consumers (e.g., app developers) to build complicated infrastructure to get onchain data. Instead, data consumers pay to query custom APIs \u2014 called \u201cSubgraphs\u201d \u2014 of onchain data via the GraphQL API. Subgraphs define a data schema to be indexed, making that data queryable. Subgraphs can be developed and queried by anyone.\n\nThe Graph Network uses its native utility token <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/the-graph\">GRT</a> to incentivize data indexing and consumption:\n\nIndexers process and store onchain data from Subgraphs. They usually have advanced technical knowledge of node operation. Indexers receive query fees in GRT from data consumers and indexing rewards from new GRT issuance.\nCurators are incentivized to analyze and signal which Subgraphs are valuable to index. Curators earn a 10% portion of the GRT query fees generated by Subgraphs.\nDelegators do not employ resources to index onchain data; instead, they delegate The Graph's native utility token <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/the-graph\">GRT</a> to Indexers. The amount of GRT query fees and indexing rewards a delegator receives is proportional to the amount of GRT delegated, less an Indexing Reward Cut (commission). There is also a 0.5% delegation tax each time a wallet delegates GRT.\n\nIn June 2024, The Graph completed its Sunrise of Decentralized Data initiative to upgrade all Subgraphs to its distributed network of approximately 100 independent Indexers. At the end of Q4\u201924, over 11,000 Subgraphs have either launched on the decentralized network or successfully transitioned from the hosted service. Following this milestone, The Graph has had consecutive quarters of all-time high query fees due to the increasing demand for data indexing.  \n\nWebsite / X (Twitter) / Discord\n\nKey Metrics\n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nThe Graph Network is used by developers and data consumers who pay to query data. The network's performance can be measured by the growth of the volume of queries serviced, the active Subgraphs serving queries, and the accrual of query fees.\n\nNetwork Overview\n\nQuery Volume\n\nDemand for data on The Graph reached an all-time high of over 5.9 billion queries in Q4, up 13% QoQ from 5.3 billion. The Ethereum Mainnet led the way with 1.3 billion successful queries (22% of the total of 5.9 billion queries) in Q4, followed by Arbitrum One 983.5 million (16.5%), Polygon 1.0 billion (14.4%), BNB Smart Chain 854.6 million (14.4%), and Base 480.7 million (8.1%). Notably, query volume decreased by 23% QoQ on Ethereum, increased by approximately 15% QoQ on each of Arbitrum One, Polygon, and BNB Smart Chain, and increased by 203% QoQ on Base.\n\nIn terms of Subgraphs with the largest query volume, Graph Network Arbitrum (5% of total queries) led the way, followed by QuickSwap V3 (4%), and UNCX Lockers V3 and V2 on BNB Chain, both of which had 3% of query volume respectively. Notably, query volumes have seen an upward trend over the past six quarters. While the initial growth in query volumes was likely driven by a recovery of crypto activity throughout 2023, there were other recent contributing factors to the increase in query volume, including:\n\na free query plan of 100,000 queries per month introduced in March 2024, as well as\nthe increase in Subgraphs published to the decentralized network, as detailed below.\n\nSubgraphs\n\nTo bootstrap The Graph, a hosted service was initially created. This service hosted Subgraphs as the protocol gradually transitioned to its decentralized network. The hosted service was free (subsidized by The Graph ecosystem) and offered indexing infrastructure run by Edge & Node, the initial team behind The Graph.\n\nThe first decentralized Subgraph launched on the decentralized network in Q1'21. In October 2023, the project introduced its Sunrise of Decentralized Data to upgrade all Subgraphs to its distributed network of independent Indexers in three phases: Sunray, Sunbeam, and Sunrise.\n\nThe first phase of the upgrade \u2014 Sunray \u2014 was completed in March 2024. Sunray brought more chains, free queries, and improved billing, including a free query plan of 100,000 queries per month. This helped developers get started on the network and scale their development.\n\nThe second phase \u2014 Sunbeam \u2014 was concluded in June 2024. Sunbeam focused on upgrading hosted service Subgraphs to The Graph Network. The third phase of the upgrade \u2014 Sunrise \u2014 retired hosted service endpoints and was completed in June 2024.\n\nAs a consequence, the number of deployed Subgraphs on The Graph\u2019s Network has steadily increased. As of the end of Q4\u201924, 11,294 active Subgraphs have either launched on The Graph\u2019s distributed network of independent data indexers or successfully transitioned from hosting services to it (+8% QoQ).\n\nTo improve performance and reduce costs, The Graph completed its migration from Ethereum Mainnet to Arbitrum, a Layer-2 scaling solution, on June 28, 2024, with 100% of indexing rewards on Arbitrum One from that day forward. This date also marked the beginning of the deprecation of The Graph\u2019s deployment on Ethereum Mainnet, which was completed%3A%20Support%20for%20most%20transfer%20tools%20is%20removed%20(see%20below).%20The%20L1%20protocol%20is%20considered%20officially%20deprecated%2C%20and%20L1%20contracts%20are%20marked%20End%2DOf%2DLife%20and%20will%20get%20no%20new%20upgrades%20or%20support.%20Participants%20may%20still%20withdraw%20any%20remaining%20GRT%20from%20the%20protocol%20contracts.) in December. In line with this transition, all new Subgraphs have been created on Arbitrum since Q3\u20192024.\n\nEcosystem Participation\n\nThe Graph\u2019s protocol economic design coordinates participation from both technical and non-technical participants to meet supply and demand for data indexing and consumption:\n\nIndexers operate Graph Nodes to process and store onchain data. Data consumers can then query this data via GraphQL, an open-source language for The Graph\u2019s APIs. Indexers receive query fees in GRT from data consumers and indexing rewards from new GRT issuance.\nCurators signal to Indexers which Subgraphs are worth indexing. Curators also often act as Subgraph developers. Curators earn a 10% portion of the GRT query fees generated by Subgraphs.\nDelegators delegate their GRT tokens to Indexers in exchange for a portion of an Indexer\u2019s GRT query fees and indexing rewards. The amount of GRT query fees and indexing rewards a delegator receives is proportional to the amount of GRT delegated, less an Indexing Reward Cut and Query Fee Cut (commissions). There is also a 0.5% delegation tax each time a wallet delegates GRT.\n\nStaked GRT is required for indexing Subgraphs and processing queries. As an Indexer stakes and is delegated more GRT, its capacity to process queries%20stake%20and%20the%20price%20the%20Indexer%20charges%20for%20each%20query%2C%20so%20the%20more%20stake%20that%20is%20allocated%20to%20an%20Indexer%2C%20the%20more%20potential%20queries%20they%20can%20process.) increases.\n\nThe minimum stake for an Indexer is currently set at 100,000 GRT (approximately $20,000 as of Dec. 31, 2024). In addition to this minimum, Indexers can also receive delegated stake from other ecosystem participants. Collectively, a maximum of 16x an Indexer\u2019s personal stake can be delegated to a given Indexer.\n\nIndexers actively serving queries on The Graph decreased 9% QoQ from 101 to 92 at the end of the fourth quarter. Q4\u201924 marks the eighth consecutive quarter of a downtrend in Indexers actively serving queries. This trend began in Q1\u201923 following the end of The Graph\u2019s Migration Infrastructure Providers incentivization program at the end of Q1\u201923 and some Indexers simultaneously unstaking GRT. Notably, the decline in the number of Indexers has not resulted in a decline in Indexer performance as these Indexers cover more Subgraphs, highlighting the network\u2019s resilience.\n\nFinancial Overview\n\nThe GRT token follows the <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/how-are-web3-infrastructure-protocols-trying-to-capture-value\">Stake-for-Access model</a>, also known as a utility token model. Participants in The Graph's ecosystem earn revenue in GRT by performing indexing and querying services on the decentralized network. Both services require GRT to be staked. An Indexer\u2019s stake comprises their own GRT tokens (i.e., self-stake) and GRT delegated toward them (i.e., delegated stake).\n\nBoth indexing rewards and query fees are funneled through Indexers, who then distribute them to Delegators and Curators. Each Indexer sets a cut (commission) on both GRT query fees and indexing rewards generated from delegated GRT with the remainder distributed proportionally according to the amount of GRT delegated. These cuts (commissions) do not apply to Curators, who earn a fixed 10% portion of the query fees generated by particular Subgraphs.\n\nSource: The Graph: Choosing Indexers\n\nAs per the above example, if an Indexer sets the query fee cut to 13.96%, its Delegators would receive the remaining 86.04% of the fee revenue proportional to their stake. While Delegator stake cannot be slashed, Delegators should still consider several factors when staking GRT with Indexers. These include:\n\nIndexer choice, i.e., choosing effective Indexers with the most optimal balance between reward payouts and \u201cskin-in-the-game\u201d from allocation of self-stake.\nUnbonding period, i.e., no GRT transfers or rewards are possible within a 28-day window after un-delegation.\nDelegation tax of 0.5%, i.e., calculating how long it takes to earn back the 0.5% tax on delegation.\n\nIndexing Rewards\n\nIndexing rewards come from new GRT issuance set by technical protocol governance. In Q4\u201924, annualized inflation from new GRT issuance averaged 2.76%. GRT rewards are distributed to Indexers staking GRT in return for providing indexing and querying services on The Graph\u2019s open marketplace.\n\nIndexing rewards increased 2% QoQ from $16.1 million to $16.5 million in Q4\u201924. In GRT terms, indexing rewards grew by an approximately equivalent amount of 1.8% QoQ to 77.5 million GRT.\n\nQuery Fees (Network Usage Fees)\n\nData consumers (e.g., app developers) pay query fees for Indexers to fetch and organize data. As of Q4\u201924, The Graph delivers data to projects like Polygon, Art Blocks, and Loopring. Query fees are determined by market demand and distributed to Curators, Indexers, and Delegators.\n\nTotal query fees increased 4.3% QoQ in USD terms to an all-time high of $215,000 in Q4\u201924. This increase in demand-side revenue in USD was primarily driven by the increase in query volume and the number of Subgraphs on the decentralized network.\n\nBy chain, Ethereum Mainnet led the way with $46,800 (21.7% of total query fees in Q4\u201924), followed by Arbitrum with $35,700 (16.8%), BNB Smart Chain with $32,500 (15.1%), Polygon with $31,800 (14.8%), and Base with $16,500 (7.7%). Notably, query fees decreased QoQ on Ethereum (-29%) and Polygon (-22%), and increased QoQ on BNB Smart Chain (+47%), Arbitrum (+17%), and Base (+147%).\n\nFor The Graph, the Q4\u201924 total query fees (over $215,000) just over 1.3% of the total indexing rewards (approximately $16.5 million), indicating that The Graph\u2019s network participants still rely on indexing rewards to sustain their day-to-day operations.\n\nQualitative Analysis\n\nKey Developments\n\nEthereum Mainnet Deprecation and L2 Transition\n\nIn December, The Graph completed%3A%20Support%20for%20most%20transfer%20tools%20is%20removed%20(see%20below).%20The%20L1%20protocol%20is%20considered%20officially%20deprecated%2C%20and%20L1%20contracts%20are%20marked%20End%2DOf%2DLife%20and%20will%20get%20no%20new%20upgrades%20or%20support.%20Participants%20may%20still%20withdraw%20any%20remaining%20GRT%20from%20the%20protocol%20contracts.) the final step in deprecating its Ethereum Mainnet (L1) protocol, with all contracts earmarked as \"end of life,\u201d though remaining GRT may still be withdrawn from the L1 contracts. This followed the successful migration on June 28, 2024, of The Graph from Ethereum's Layer-1 Mainnet to Arbitrum, an L2 scaling solution to address the challenges of high gas fees and slower transactions on Mainnet. Specifically, June 28, 2024, was the first with 100% of indexing rewards on Arbitrum One, and the beginning of the deprecation of The Graph\u2019s Mainnet deployment, with only essential functions like the token bridge remaining operational from that date forward.\n\nChain Integrations\n\nIntegrating a chain with The Graph protocol follows three stages: Technical Integration via a forum thread, Integration Validation, and Mainnet Integration, which requires governance approval via a Graph Improvement proposal (GIP) and enables GRT indexing rewards. Since Q3 2024, The Graph has completed integrations with numerous chains, extending its support to more than 100 blockchains. Notable chains that have completed the Chain Integration Process since Q3 2024 include Boba Network (Nov. 12), Moonbeam (Jan. 24), and Mode (Feb. 11). Other notable integrations include:\n\nStarknet Firehose and Substreams Integration (Oct. 31) - StreamingFast, a core developer of The Graph, announced support on Starknet for Firehose, its blockchain data streaming technology, and Substreams, a parallel blockchain indexing solution.\nSolana Substreams Integration (Nov. 3) - The Graph Foundation announced support for Solana with Substreams, a parallel blockchain indexing solution.\nOther Integrations - Chiliz Chain (Oct. 8), Unichain testnet (Oct. 10), Blockscout (Nov. 11), Lens Chain (Nov. 12), Botanix (Dec. 4), Mantra (Dec. 4), Corn (Dec. 12), and 0x Loky (Dec. 20).\n\nOther Key Developments\n\nGraphTally, previously Timeline Aggregation Protocol (TAP) - As of December, GraphTally, The Graph\u2019s micropayment system, processed over 80% of payments on The Graph. To date, GraphTally processes the vast majority of payments on The Graph. GraphTally (previously TAP) mainnet launched in September and enables Indexers to handle receipts offchain and later redeem them using Receipt Aggregate Vouchers (RAVs) onchain.\nRecognizing GRT on Base as Canonical - On December 6, 2024, The Graph Council voted to officially recognize the GRT token on Base as canonical by approving (GGP-0047).\nThe Graph Joins the Hypersonic Builders Alliance (HBA) - In December, The Graph announced it had joined the Hypersonic Builders Alliance (HBA) to bring blockchain data solutions to Soneium, an Ethereum Layer-2 network developed by Sony Block Solutions Labs (Sony BSL). Soneium launched its mainnet in January with The Graph partnering as a launch collaborator since August 2024.\nSebastian Lorenz New Edge & Node CTO - In January, Sebastian Lorenz joined Edge & Node, a core developer team for The Graph, as its new Chief Technology Officer (CTO).\nKraken Launches GRT Staking - In January, crypto exchange Kraken announced it had GRT staking support for U.S. clients in 37 states and two territories.\n\nCommunity\n\nCommunity Support Programs\n\nThe Graph is supported by a number of community support programs funded by The Graph Foundation. Amongst these programs, there were a number of notable events, activities, and initiatives undertaken in the fourth quarter.\n\nIn October, The Graph India closed submissions and announced winners for its Bootcamp and Hackathon with 21 project submissions and participation from more than 120 students.\nDatapalooza, The Graph\u2019s annual event, took place in November during Devcon in Bangkok.\n@GraphDevs, a dedicated Twitter account serving as a hub for developers, released a developer survey in December to solicit feedback.\n\nKey Governance\n\nGRC-20 A Knowledge Standard for Web3\n\nIn November, Geo, a core developer team for The Graph, proposed GRC-20, a knowledge graph data standard that aims to establish a unified, interoperable data structure for decentralized applications in Web3. GRC-20 is designed to enable the sharing and extension of information across various domains by organizing knowledge into structured components. These components include:\n\nSpaces: Logical groupings that represent individuals, communities, or projects acting as containers for organizing and managing knowledge graphs. Public spaces reside onchain while personal spaces can be private or selectively shared.\nEntities and Relations: Entities represent a unique concept, such as a person, place, object, or idea, while Relations define the connections between these entities, forming a graph-like structure.\nTriples: The foundational units of knowledge in GRC-20. Each triple consists of three elements\u2014an Entity, an Attribute, and a Value (e.g., Entity: \"Actor\", Attribute: \"Name\", Value: \"John Doe\"). Triples can be extended, modified, and referenced across the ecosystem.\nEncoding and IDs: GRC-20 employs Protobufs for encoding data. Each entity is assigned a globally unique 22-character ID, created using Base58 encoding. These IDs ensure that data is universally accessible and free from collisions.\n\nTo date, GRC-20 remains in a draft stage as a Graph Request for Comment (GRC-0020) pending public comments. Following this stage, GRC-20 will be finalized as an initial standard that can be updated over time.\n\nUpdates to The Graph Improvement Proposal (GIP) Process\n\nIn January, The Graph Council voted to approve GIP-0061, simplifying The Graph Improvement Proposal (GIP) process by removing the Graph Request for Proposals (GRP) step. It also introduces clearer instructions on how to complete GIP auditing, testing, and discussion and an intake form to request actions necessary to complete such requirements.\n\nClosing Summary\n\nIn Q4, demand for data on The Graph reached an all-time high of over 5.9 billion queries, up 13% QoQ from 5.3 billion. Additionally, demand-side fees in USD grew by 4.3% QoQ to an all-time high of $215,000. Moreover, at the end of the fourth quarter, there were more than 11,200 active Subgraphs on The Graph, an increase of 8% QoQ from 10,400.\n\nBeyond these metrics, a number of key developments took place. In November, The Graph team introduced GRC-20, a proposed knowledge graph standard, while in December, the final step in deprecating its Ethereum Mainnet (L1) protocol was completed, with all contracts earmarked as \u201cend of life.\u201d The Graph also integrated with multiple networks since Q3\u201924, including Boba, Unichain, and Mantra, extending its support to more than 100 chains.\n\nAs The Graph moves into its fifth year of operation, it will look to continue to expand its coverage and use via new and existing data services like Firehose, Substreams, and other to-be-launched offerings.", "published_on": "2025-03-07T17:00:00Z", "url": "https://messari.io/article/state-of-the-graph-q4-2024", "source": "Messari", "author": "Matt Kreiser", "sentiment":
