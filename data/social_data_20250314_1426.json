The notable bleeding of major stock indexes has trickled down into the crypto market, as Bitcoin price slipped from trading above $101k to around $82k on Thursday, March 13, during the early New York trading session. The altcoin market has recorded the highest losses in the past few months, led by Ethereum (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE). As a result, the question lingering in most crypto traders is when and if an altseason will happen in 2025. Altseason 2025 Key Insights From historical data, the altcoin season has been kickstarted by the reversal of the macro Bitcoin dominance. However, the introduction of spot crypto ETFs has significantly disrupted the historical crypto cash rotation, thus complicating the expected timeline of the altseason 2025. From a technical analysis perspective, the Others/BTC pair in the weekly timeframe is currently retesting a crucial support level, which in the past cycles yielded parabolic altseason. However, the altseason will be delayed if the altcoin market fails to rebound from the current levels in the coming weeks. #Altseason is Ready To Go $Total 2 is showing the same ready-to-go pattern for Altseason.

However, the administration change in the United States under President Donald Trump, which has significantly focused on providing clear crypto regulations, has favored a rejuvenated mainstream adoption of digital assets , led by DeFi tokens. The launch of the Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin has heavily democratized the adoption of crypto assets by retail and institutional investors. Considering all the factors, top altcoins to keep a close watch on in the anticipated altseason include the heavily oversold tokens, especially those with robust leadership and a supportive online community.

Chief Judge John Dorsey rejected FTX\u2019s debtors\u2019 argument that the amended proof of claim (POC) from 3AC liquidators was untimely and an unjust attempt to slow the bankruptcy proceedings. In a March 13 ruling in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, Dorsey opined that 3AC liquidators had provided sufficient notice of their claim and the possibility of amending it once they had analyzed all the available information. Any delay, he said, was caused by FTX\u2019s failure to share relevant records promptly. Chief Judge John Dorsey has granted the motion by liquidators for defunct hedge fund Three Arrows Capital to increase their claim against FTX to $1.53 billion. Source: \u201cThe evidence suggests that the delay in filing the Amended Proof of Claim was, in large part, caused by the Debtors themselves,\u201d Dorsey said. \u201cThe evidence also suggests that the Liquidators were diligent in attempting to obtain the information and that despite having the complete information in their possession, the Debtors repeatedly delayed giving it to them.\u201d 3AC liquidators initially filed a $120 million claim in FTX\u2019s bankruptcy case in June 2023. They later expanded it in November 2024 , alleging claims including breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and breach of fiduciary duty. The liquidators alleged FTX held $1.53 billion in the hedge fund assets that were liquidated to settle $1.33 billion in liabilities in 2022. They argued that the transactions were avoidable, caused harm to 3AC creditors and that FTX debtors had delayed providing the information that would have uncovered the liquidation. FTX debtors objected to the amended claim, saying that the original POC was insufficient to inform them about the nature and amount 3AC liquidators would be claiming and that it came too late and should be disallowed. Related: FTX filed for bankruptcy 2 years ago \u2014 What\u2019s happening now? Before its collapse in June 2022 , Three Arrows Capital was once one of the industry\u2019s largest crypto hedge funds, with over $3 billion in assets. Its liquidators also pursued claims against collapsed crypto firm Terraform Labs through a $1.3 billion claim in Terra\u2019s bankruptcy case. At the same time, FTX, which filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, has been undertaking its own recovery efforts to reclaim funds. In November last year, it filed a trio of lawsuits, one against SkyBridge Capital and its founder, Anthony Scaramucci, to recoup funds spent by former FTX CEO Sam \u201cSBF\u201d Bankman-Fried on sponsorship and investment deals. Another suit was filed against crypto exchange Binance and its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao , to recover $1.76 billion worth of cryptocurrency sent to the exchange as part of a July 2021 repurchase deal.

Data shows that investors closed 795 deals in the U.S in AI from January to March, with blockbuster deals like Databricks' $15.3 billion round and Anthropic's $2 billion raise dominating headlines. Crypto's largest blockbuster deal, in comparison, was Abu Dhabi's MGX, with a $2 billion investment into Binance \u2013 the first institutional placement in the crypto exchange. Other deals of note include a $82 million raise from payment infrastructure company Mesh, ETF issuer Bitwise's $70 million round, and digital asset bank Sygnum's $58 million offering. Prior reporting by Pitchbook shows that AI startups attracted one-third of global VC investment in 2024, totaling $131.5 billion, with nearly a quarter of new startups being an AI company across 4,318 VC deals, compared to crypto's $4.9 billion across just 706 deals. Analysis: Has AI stolen crypto's venture dollars? Blockbuster rounds from VCs in the AI space and headline-grabbing antics, such as OpenAI's Sam Altman seeking trillions , and AI's rise from technological novelty to household name thanks to transformer models , would make one think that there's suddenly an investor preference for one over the other. Historically, all data shows that VCs have generally favored AI over crypto, with AI and machine learning attracting consistent funding that's expanded exponentially, according to Statista data , growing from $670 million in 2011 to $36 billion in 2020. There's only been one year where crypto beat AI for funding, and that comes with a caveat: narrower AI categorizations, like ABI Research 's $22.3 billion AI estimate in 2021, suggest crypto briefly outpaced AI funding during the bullish crypto cycle before AI funding surged again to over $100 billion by 2024. Keep in mind that all of this ignores crypto-native quirks like airdrops, which put fresh capital in the hands of users and, in turn, pump the token price, inflating the size of projects' treasuries. A recent report from Dragonfly found that between 2020 and 2024, the 11 largest airdrops generated $7 billion.

According to SIMD Vote Status, 61.39% of voters supported the SIMD-228 governance vote, which was less than the 66.67% required for approval. With a record 74% turnout by the end of voting on Mar. 13, it was the biggest crypto governance vote ever in terms of both market value and participation. The voting pattern revealed a rift among network members despite high engagement. More than 60% of smaller validators with 500,000 Solana ( SOL ) or less voted against the proposal. Validators with greater stakes, on the other hand, overwhelmingly backed it, indicating how the proposal would have impacted various groups. The current inflation system in Solana strikes a balance between burning transaction fees and generating staking rewards. More fees are burned during periods of high network activity, which helps keep inflation under control. You might also like: Solana still leads in DEX trading volumes despite meme coin frenzy cool-off However, fewer tokens are being removed from circulation as transaction costs have declined. Meanwhile, at an inflation rate of 4.7%, staking rewards keep adding new SOL to the market. The goal of SIMD -228 was to reduce staking rewards, which would slow the growth of SOL\u2019s supply and potentially raise its value. Under the proposal, inflation would have fallen below 1% at the current 65% staking rate. However, smaller validators would have had difficulty remaining profitable, as many of them charge little to no commission. If enough of them left the network, Solana\u2019s decentralization could have weakened, raising concerns about long-term stability. While SIMD-228 failed, a different proposal, SIMD-123, passed with almost 75% support. This modification will enable validators to distribute rewards more transparently by allowing them to split a portion of their earnings with stakeholders via an on-chain system. According to the findings from the just concluded vote, network participants prefer changing validator incentives over lowering inflation.

The country is currently grappling with a shortage of US dollars and an ongoing fuel crisis, which has resulted in lengthy lines at gas stations. Fuel Crisis And Dollar Shortage Bolivia is facing financial difficulties due to the decline in natural gas exports, which were once a major source of foreign currency. The decline in US dollar reserves has made it more difficult to pay for imported fuel. s a result, fuel shortages have been a source of public discontent and demonstrations in Bolivia. The government has approved YPFB using crypto to purchase gasoline supplies. The company has not yet carried out any even though it has license to do transactions using digital assets. Bolivia\u2019s YPFB will use cryptocurrency for energy imports amid a dollar shortage, mirroring Venezuela\u2019s failed petro experiment. Fuel protests continue as the country struggles with declining natural gas exports. https://t.co/JtmWTnhRJW \u2014 OilPrice.com (@OilandEnergy) March 12, 2025 Crypto As A Payment Method The way YPFB looks at digital currency payments matches an increasing trend in other South American countries. Nations like Venezuela and Argentina use digital assets to get around financial limits and make international trade possible. Bolivia\u2019s decision should keep the government\u2019s fuel subsidy program running, even though it doesn\u2019t have much money. Bitcoin Ban Bolivia\u2019s central bank banned Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies until June 2024, citing economic struggles and alignment with regional regulations. However, the ban was lifted as crypto gained global acceptance, with countries like El Salvador, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico adopting it earlier. YPFB hasn\u2019t fully disclosed which cryptocurrencies it wants to use, but officials think digital assets could be a good way to make payments across borders. The lack of money makes traditional transactions progressively difficult. Bolivia might have a different payment option thanks to cryptocurrencies that lets it keep importing gas. Impact In The Energy Domain Bolivia\u2019s financial problems have worsened the situation since the nation depends much on imported petroleum. Cryptocurrencies could help keep the energy supply stable by giving people a new way to pay for things from other countries. Still, it\u2019s not clear how well this method will work to solve the bigger economic problems that are at play. Meanwhile, crypto payments may pose legal and volatility problems, experts say. Despite their fears, the government believes this is important to secure the oil supply. Bolivia\u2019s approach could inspire other countries with financial issues if its plan works.

The poll revealed that 57% of the respondents thought that the economic policies have created an unsteady situation as some decisions have triggered global trade wars. 51% believed that the economy would worsen a year from now, 7 points higher than in January before the president took office. 55% of the poll\u2019s respondents also believed that Trump\u2019s cuts to federal programs would do more economic harm than good. The respondents also suggested that the president should try to combat the current high consumer prices. A majority of the respondents also worried that the policies would drive prices up instead of bringing them down. Trump enacted the import tariffs last week, imposing 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports and a 10% tariff on Chinese imports. Other policies include tax cuts, reductions in government spending, cuts to federal programs, mass layoffs of federal workers, and deregulation. The president\u2019s policies have sparked uncertainty on Wall Street and in the crypto markets, leading to plunges in stocks and most digital assets. The markets also experienced major sell-offs on Monday amid the increasing fear. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.08% on Monday and is down 1.25% today. The S&P 500 dropped 2.7% on Monday and is down 1.37% today. Bitcoin dropped below $77,000 this week before recovering to above $80,000.

Several indicators, like the higher unemployment rate in February, show the slowdown in the economy after Trump\u2019s presidency. The February Consumer Price Index (CPI) report also revealed a 2.8% rise in inflation year-on-year. The inflation still cooled down compared to January\u2019s 3.0% rise on an annual basis. A recession involves a sharp and significant decline in economic activity that lasts more than a few months. Groundwork Collective\u2019s policy and advocacy chief, Alex Jacquez, reportedly mentioned that the economy\u2019s driver depended on businesses investing and hiring and people spending. Jacquez further suggested that spending could be reduced if citizens feared for their jobs or more layoffs in the future. The CNN poll notably highlighted that respondents were cutting back on part of their spending to sustain their budget. 71% of the respondents changed the kind of groceries they used to buy in order to stay within their budget. To afford necessities, 67% of the respondents had to cut on extra spending like entertainment and extras. JPMorgan Chase has predicted a 40% chance of recession if Trump continues with his \u2018extreme\u2019 economic policies. Goldman Sachs also raised the probability of recession from 15% to 20% due to the slow house market, Trump\u2019s tariffs, and government spending cuts. Economist Justin Wolfers further mentioned that the \u2018chaotic\u2019 Trump policies could trigger a recession. The prediction market Polymarket\u2019s poll on \u2018U.S. Recession in 2025?\u2019 currently has a 39% vote. Consumer confidence drops significantly in February Consumer confidence plunged drastically in February, dropping to the lowest level in three and a half years, dropping from 105.3 in January to 98.3 in February. As Americans indicated anxiety about economic conditions worsening, 12-month inflation worries also rose among consumers. Consumer Confidence in February Source: Reuters FWDBONDS chief economist Christopher Rupkey commented on the dropping consumer confidence, mentioning that Americans were being more pessimistic about the future outlook. Rupkey explained that Trump\u2019s administration was the first administration to threaten mass layoffs of federal employees. The economist also mentioned that the policies could cause a halt in the economy as soon as the first quarter of this year. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

As Robinhood adds Pengu (PENGU), Pnut (PNUT), and Popcat (POPCAT) to its platform to meet growing retail demand, CZ has pushed back against claims that he sought a presidential pardon from Donald Trump. CZ Denies Seeking Trump Pardon Amidst Wall Street Journal Allegations Changpeng \u201d CZ \u201d Zhao, the former CEO of Binance, has vehemently denied allegations that he had seeked a presidential pardon from US President Donald Trump. The claims, initially published in a March 13 report by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), suggested that CZ was exploring avenues for legal relief that could allow him to reassume an operational role at Binance or otherwise regain influence in the crypto industry. Zhao took to X shortly after the report's release to refute the claims, stating that he never discussed a business arrangement between the Trump family and Binance.US. He further denied that he had ever pursued a pardon from Trump, calling the report part of a broader political attack against the president and the cryptocurrency sector. \u201cNo felon would mind a pardon, especially being the only one in US history who was ever sentenced to prison for a single BSA [Bank Secrecy Act] charge,\u201d Zhao wrote. \u201cFeels like the article is motivated as an attack on the President and crypto, and the residual forces of the \u2018war on crypto\u2019 from the last administration are still at work.\u201d Zhao\u2019s legal troubles stem from a landmark case in which Binance reached a $4.3 billion settlement with US authorities in November 2023. As part of the agreement, Zhao pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) for failing to implement an effective anti-money laundering program at Binance. He subsequently stepped down as CEO and was sentenced to four months in prison. The plea deal also reportedly included a stipulation barring him from any operational or managerial role at Binance indefinitely. Despite serving his sentence, the implications of Zhao\u2019s conviction continue to be a focal point of scrutiny, particularly as the regulatory landscape for crypto shifts under the new administration. While a presidential pardon from Trump would not erase Zhao\u2019s conviction, it could potentially lift some of the legal restrictions imposed on him. According to the US Department of Justice, a pardon \u201dremoves legal disabilities imposed because of the conviction,\u201d meaning it could open the door for Zhao to resume certain professional activities within the cryptocurrency space. However, legal experts argue that a pardon\u2019s impact would likely be limited. The $4.3 billion settlement agreement with US authorities\u2014including the permanent injunction against Zhao\u2019s involvement in Binance\u2014may still hold, regardless of whether Trump grants him clemency. Additionally, such a move would likely face intense scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators who have sought to hold Binance accountable for its alleged past regulatory lapses. The Political and Regulatory Landscape: A Crypto Shift Under Trump? The WSJ report also speculated that Trump\u2019s administration has been taking a markedly different approach to cryptocurrency regulation. Since Trump took office in January, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reportedly paused multiple enforcement actions against major crypto firms, including some entities linked to those who supported his campaign or inauguration fund. One of the most notable examples is the SEC\u2019s decision to file for a 60-day pause in its legal battle with Binance, a move that followed the departure of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The shift in approach has sparked speculation that Trump\u2019s administration may be looking to ease regulatory pressures on the crypto industry. Additionally, reports suggest that the SEC may soon conclude its civil case against Ripple Labs, a long-running lawsuit that has been a defining legal battle for the crypto industry. If the SEC opts to drop its case against Ripple, it could set a precedent for further regulatory softening under Trump. While Zhao remains one of the most influential figures in the crypto world, his ability to directly participate in Binance\u2019s operations or any major crypto firm remains uncertain. Even if Trump were to grant him a pardon, Zhao would still face scrutiny from regulators and financial institutions wary of Binance\u2019s history of compliance issues. For Binance itself, the legal battles with US regulators remain a significant overhang. While the company has taken steps to improve its regulatory standing\u2014including leadership changes and compliance overhauls\u2014its future in the US market remains uncertain. Meanwhile, Zhao has hinted at a desire to remain involved in the industry in some capacity, even if not directly linked to Binance. His recent social media activity suggests that he remains deeply engaged with the broader crypto ecosystem and may seek alternative ways to contribute. Robinhood Expands Crypto Offerings with PENGU, PNUT, and POPCAT Listings Amid Rising Meme Coin Demand In other news, Robinhood has officially expanded its cryptocurrency offerings by listing three new meme coins\u2014Pengu (PENGU), Pnut (PNUT), and Popcat (POPCAT)\u2014as part of its aggressive push into the digital asset space. The latest listings signal a strategic shift by Robinhood, which is capitalizing on the growing retail interest in speculative crypto assets following US President Trump's election victory. As regulatory winds shift in favor of the crypto industry, exchanges are accelerating the addition of new digital assets, with meme coins emerging as a key battleground. Meme coins\u2014initially dismissed as mere internet jokes\u2014have evolved into a legitimate market force, attracting billions in trading volume. Dogecoin (DOGE), the sector's largest asset by market capitalization, has already been available on Robinhood, but the platform's latest expansion into lesser-known meme coins reflects a broader strategy to meet retail demand. The decision to list PENGU, PNUT, and POPCAT follows a February statement from Robinhood Crypto, which revealed a significant uptick in customer interest in meme coin trading. This customer-driven approach appears to be paying off, as Robinhood\u2019s crypto revenues soared 700% year-over-year in early 2024. Meme coins, often fueled by online communities and social media hype, have become a major driver of speculative trading activity, particularly among retail investors looking for short-term gains. Robinhood\u2019s Crypto Expansion and Competitive Strategy While Robinhood is traditionally known as a stock trading platform, the company has significantly ramped up its crypto-focused services over the past year. In January, it launched crypto futures trading, providing users with more advanced trading options beyond spot buying and selling. The brokerage\u2019s latest meme coin listings indicate a direct challenge to established crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Binance.US, both of which have rapidly expanded their token listings since Trump\u2019s election win. As crypto adoption grows, the competition among platforms to capture retail traders is intensifying, with meme coins acting as an entry point for many new investors. Robinhood\u2019s expansion into crypto has not only been strategic but also lucrative. The platform reported record-breaking trading volumes across equities, options, and cryptocurrencies in Q4 2024, with crypto trading seeing the highest percentage growth. A crucial factor in Robinhood\u2019s accelerated push into crypto is the changing regulatory landscape in the US. Under former SEC Chair Gensler, the agency took an aggressive stance against the crypto industry, arguing that most digital assets should be classified as securities and thus subject to strict regulation. However, following Trump\u2019s election and the appointment of crypto-friendly regulators, the SEC\u2019s stance on digital assets has softened considerably. In February 2024, the SEC made a landmark declaration, stating that most meme coins do not qualify as securities and, therefore, do not fall under its jurisdiction. This announcement was a stark reversal from the Biden administration\u2019s regulatory approach, which had imposed heavy enforcement actions on crypto exchanges and platforms. Additionally, the SEC dropped an enforcement action against Robinhood in February, which had alleged that the company\u2019s crypto trading platform violated securities laws. This decision further signaled a regulatory shift favoring innovation and crypto adoption, providing platforms like Robinhood with greater flexibility to list new assets without facing immediate legal scrutiny. With Robinhood continuing to expand its crypto services and token offerings, the platform is positioning itself as a major player in the evolving digital asset market. Meme coins, once viewed as a niche segment, are now attracting institutional attention and massive retail trading volume, with some tokens even outperforming traditional cryptocurrencies in certain market cycles. With Trump\u2019s administration signaling pro-crypto policies, the industry could see further regulatory easing, making it easier for platforms to list new assets without fear of legal action.", "published_on": "2025-03-14T13:30:00", "url": "https://coinpaper.com/7987/cz-refutes-wsj-report-on-trump-pardon-calls-it-politically-motivated", "source": "coinpaper", "categories": ["REGULATION", "EXCHANGE", "BNB", "TRADING", "MARKET"], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.08345634329240889, "subjectivity": 0.42615706242755425, "sentiment": "neutral"}, "entities": ["ripple", "dogecoin"], "topics": ["trump", "meme", "pardon", "regulatory", "binance"]}, {"id": "41629008", "title": "Texas court issues judgment against Bancor DAO after it ignored summons", "body": "A Texas federal judge has entered a default judgment against Bancor DAO, which operated the decentralized finance platform Bancor, after it failed to respond to an online summons.

Meanwhile, the European Central Bank is struggling to gain public support for the digital euro, as consumers show little interest in adopting a central bank digital currency. In contrast, stablecoin adoption in Latin America is surging, with USDC and USDT becoming preferred financial tools due to high inflation and economic instability. Stablecoin Bill Faces Resistance from Bankers The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins ( GENIUS ) Act is facing resistance from US bankers and their allies in the Senate, who are concerned that stablecoins could disintermediate traditional financial institutions and erode their market share. According to an article from American Banker , the bill requires 60 votes to pass, which means that it needs support from at least seven Democratic senators alongside Republicans. This presents a bit of a challenge, as influential people like Senator Elizabeth Warren are still opposed to the legislation. Warren proposed an amendment that will prohibit tech firms from issuing stablecoins, and argued that only regulated financial institutions should have the ability to facilitate payments. She also warned that the bill disrupts the existing framework by allowing big tech and corporate entities to enter the stablecoin market. Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott, R-S.C., and committee ranking member Elizabeth Warren The rise of digital assets fundamentally altered financial dynamics by offering near-instant settlement times and much lower transaction fees. Stablecoins, in particular, demonstrated their ability to reduce the costs of cross-border payments and facilitate direct peer-to-peer transactions. The GENIUS Act was introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty on Feb. 4, and it seeks to provide a clear regulatory framework for stablecoin issuance and integration in the US financial system. The proposal attracted a lot of support from people like Federal Reserve Bank Governor Christopher Waller , who believes that non-bank entities should be allowed to issue stablecoins. Waller argues that stablecoins could enhance payment use cases, particularly in the developing world, by improving cost efficiency and accessibility. The potential benefits have not gone unnoticed in the banking sector either, with Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan recently revealing that the institution is exploring the possibility of launching its own stablecoin. Stablecoins are also getting recognition at the highest levels of government. During the first White House Crypto Summit on March 7, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pointed out that stablecoins could play a big role in maintaining US dollar dominance. Overcollateralized stablecoin issuers are now among the largest buyers of US government debt, ranking 18th globally and surpassing countries like Germany and South Korea in their purchases. Policymakers advocating for stablecoin adoption argue that by implementing supportive regulations and promoting the global use of stablecoins, the US government can leverage them as a financial tool to absorb inflationary pressures and reinforce the dollar\u2019s status as the world\u2019s reserve currency. However, the ongoing political battle over the GENIUS Act also proves that there is still a deep divide between traditional financial institutions looking to protect their market dominance and supporters of digital assets. ECB Struggles to Sell Digital Euro Meanwhile, European consumers have shown very little interest in adopting a central bank digital currency, which raised some concerns for the European Central Bank as it prepares for a potential rollout of the digital euro. A recent ECB working paper on consumer attitudes toward a central bank digital currency surveyed around 19,000 respondents across 11 euro-area countries, and it revealed major communication challenges that are discouraging European households from embracing the digital euro. When asked to hypothetically allocate 10,000 euros across different assets, Europeans allocated only a small portion to the digital euro. The March 12 ECB report found that Europeans strongly prefer existing payment methods and do not see a good enough reason to adopt a digital euro due to the vast selection of offline and online payment alternatives. The findings indicate that convincing consumers of the benefits of a CBDC will be a major challenge for policymakers, and will require a lot more research and targeted communication efforts. While the study suggested that introducing a digital euro will not disrupt financial stability, it shed some light on the fact that consumer habits pose a major hurdle to its adoption. Reasons for not adopting digital euro (Source: ECB ) The report also pointed out the importance of strategic education efforts to address consumer reluctance. It found that European consumers responded positively to video-based education and training, which means that clear and concise communication through short videos could help shift public perceptions. Consumers who were exposed to video explanations about the digital euro\u2019s key features were more likely to update their views and consider adopting the new payment method compared to those who received no such information. The study was released at a time when US lawmakers are stepping up opposition to central bank digital currencies. At a House Financial Services Committee hearing on March 11, Representative Tom Emmer argued that Congress should prioritize stablecoin legislation while blocking any potential introduction of a US CBDC. Emmer described CBDCs as inherently un-American and insisted that unelected officials should not have the power to issue them. He also reintroduced the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, which seeks to prevent future US administrations from launching a central bank digital currency. Emmer speaks during the House Financial Services Committee Hearing While resistance to CBDCs remains strong in the US, there are calls in Europe to move forward with the digital euro. Stablecoin Adoption Surges in Latin America Despite the US and Europe being hesitant to adopt stablecoins and CBDCs, stablecoin adoption in Latin America is on the rise as users increasingly turn to Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT for financial stability. This is according to a new report from cryptocurrency exchange Bitso. The report revealed that stablecoins accounted for 39% of total purchases on Bitso in 2024, which was a 9% increase from the previous year. The growing reliance on stablecoins is attributed to economic instability in the region, particularly high inflation and currency devaluation, making USDC and USDT preferred stores of value. Top 10 purchased cryptos on Bitso in 2024 (Source: Bitso ) While stablecoin purchases surged, Bitcoin trading on Bitso declined a lot, and dropped to 22% of total purchases from 38% in the second half of 2023. The report suggests that this shift indicates a growing preference for the hodl strategy, where investors accumulate Bitcoin for long-term gains rather than active trading. The decline in BTC purchases also coincided with the bull market of 2024, during which Bitcoin surpassed $100,000 for the first time in December. As Bitcoin buying slowed, stablecoin purchases increased, with USDC leading at 24% of total transactions, followed by USDT at 15%. Top crypto assets by country (Source: Bitso ) Argentina was the strongest market for USDT, with the stablecoin making up 50% of all crypto purchases in the country. Given Argentina\u2019s inflation rates, stablecoins have become an essential financial tool for local users. USDC purchases accounted for 22% of the country\u2019s total crypto transactions, while Bitcoin purchases were only 8%, the lowest among the analyzed nations.

According to Gasparino, a key issue under consideration by the SEC is \u201cwhether $XRP continues to trade and have a utility that makes it more a commodity and not a security.\u201d He further noted that the case of Ethereum (ETH) is an important reference point in these discussions.

Gasparino explained that \u201cwhat is being discussed now is the comparison between the two cryptos,\u201d highlighting the SEC\u2019s attempt to determine whether XRP could receive the same treatment as Ethereum. He added, \u201cThe SEC believe Eth trades as pure commodity. They are trying to determine if the commission can make that case w $XRP.\u201d This development follows years of legal proceedings between Ripple and the SEC . It began in December 2020 when the commission filed a lawsuit against Ripple, alleging that the company had conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP. Since then, Ripple has argued that XRP should not be considered a security, emphasizing its decentralized nature and use in cross-border transactions.

If XRP were officially recognized as a commodity, it could bring greater regulatory clarity and potentially remove barriers to wider adoption. However, the SEC\u2019s final decision remains uncertain, and market participants closely monitor developments. As negotiations between Ripple and the SEC progress, the question of XRP\u2019s classification remains a pivotal issue.

For the past year, Ethereum price has faced intense bearish sentiment after experiencing a heightened resistance level of around $4k. From a technical analysis standpoint, the ETH/USD is heavily oversold compared to Bitcoin. As a result, Ether\u2019s price must rebound from the current support level to avoid further capitulation towards $1.5k in the coming weeks. Additionally, the ETH/BTC pair has been retesting a crucial support level of around 0.023 in the past week, which could incubate bullish sentiment in the near future.

She pointed to escalating trade tensions and unpredictable tariff battles as major risks, saying that his economic decisions are fueling \u201ca level of uncertainty that we haven\u2019t seen in a long time.\u201d Speaking to the BBC on Thursday, Christine said that if a full-scale trade war erupts, global markets will take a severe hit. \u201cIf we were to go to a real trade war where trade would be dampened significantly, that would have severe consequences,\u201d said Christine. \u201cFor growth around the world and for prices around the world, but particularly in the United States.\u201d Trump\u2019s tariff threats set off global panic Since returning to the White House, Trump has reignited his aggressive tariff agenda, rolling out new economic policies at random and crashing global markets every other day. Just this Thursday, he announced plans to impose a 200% tariff on French wine, champagne, and other European alcoholic beverages, which came after the European Union (EU) proposed a tax on American whiskey exports, a direct response to Trump\u2019s earlier steel and aluminum tariffs that went into effect on Wednesday. During her interview , Christine made it clear that: \u201cAny trade war is going to hurt the global economy. The initiator, the retaliator, the re-retaliator, and so on and so forth\u2014all of that is going to hurt growth at large.\u201d She stressed that trade conflicts always lead to economic damage, affecting some countries more than others, but ultimately ensuring that everyone loses. Christine also dismissed Trump\u2019s claim that the EU was \u201cformed to screw\u201d the United States. She called the statement historically inaccurate and pointed out that the EU was actually built with American support after World War II to stabilize Europe. \u201cTo argue that it was set up to screw the United States is not just bad language, but it is an abuse of history,\u201d Christine said to BBC. Business leaders panic as Trump\u2019s policies create economic uncertainty As Trump\u2019s erratic economic decisions play out, top business executives are scrambling to figure out what comes next. CEOs from IBM, Qualcomm, and HP have been making frantic calls to the White House, demanding clarity on the administration\u2019s tariff agenda. They no longer believe they can convince Trump to reverse his trade decisions, but they are desperate for some kind of predictability. Last Monday, Trump met with top executives in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. During the closed-door discussion, tech CEOs shared concerns that the tariffs could severely damage their industries. But instead of addressing their worries, Trump told reporters afterward that the meeting focused on business investments in the US. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett has reportedly spent the past two days on the phone with the CEOs, trying to reassure them. Even some Republican lawmakers have admitted that they are not confident in Trump\u2019s economic strategy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged last week that the economy needed a \u201cdetox\u201d but avoided giving specifics. On Sunday, Trump himself admitted in a Fox News interview that his tariffs could push the economy into a recession but refused to change course. That same day, his comments caused a stock market panic, triggering a massive selloff that wiped out every gain on Wall Street since his first election in 2016. By Tuesday, Trump was downplaying concerns, saying the economy was strong, and that he doesn\u2019t care about the stock market, because it\u2019s a \u201cfake economy.\u201d But White House spokesperson Kush Desai dismissed claims of internal division, insisting that Trump\u2019s team is united. \u201cEvery member of the Trump administration is playing from the same playbook\u2014President Trump\u2019s playbook\u2014to enact an America First agenda of tariffs, tax cuts, deregulation, and the unleashing of American energy,\u201d Desai said on Thursday.

The complaint was made against Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin and the director of the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission, Lawrence Bengal, on March 13 in the US District Court Eastern District of Arkansas. It follows a federal court ruling last November that temporarily barred Arkansas from preventing a naturalized US citizen of Chinese descent from operating a crypto mining business. The Arkansas state rules concerned are \u201cRule K\u201d and \u201cAct 174,\u201d which prohibits foreign-party controlled businesses in the state. Director Connor L. Kempton of the Arkansas Cryptomining Association said the vagueness of Rule K and Act 174 gives the defendants arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement powers, enabling them to grant or deny permits at their own discretion. He said the application of Rule K and Act 174 is unconstitutional and can be discriminatory based on race, alienage and national origin, among other things. Excerpt from the ACA\u2019s complaint filed against Bengal and Griffin. Source: Court document reviewed by Cointelegraph Kempton noted that these rules were enforced against crypto mining firm Jones Eagle LLC, which is run by Qimin \u201cJimmy\u201d Chen, a naturalized US citizen of Chinese origin. Kempton specifically pointed to the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution in arguing the illegality of Rule K and Act 174. Related: Russia bans crypto mining for 6 years in 10 regions The Equal Protection Clause similarly prohibits the US states from denying any person equal protection of the laws based on the person\u2019s race, alienage or national origin. The crypto mining executive also argued that Rule K and Act 174 strip American citizens like Chen of due process rights under the 14th Amendment. Kempton also said the prohibitions and penalties imposed under Act 174 infringe on the federal government\u2019s authority to investigate, review and take action on foreign investments. \u201cAct 174 seeks to establish Arkansas's own foreign policy, thereby intruding upon the federal government's exclusive power to govern foreign affairs.\u201d District Court Judge Kristine G. Baker said on Dec. 9 that the Arkansas state officials were barred from enforcing Act 174 against Jones Eagle until further notice.

United States President Donald Trump assumed office in November for a second term, but since then, the US stock market has dropped by about 10%. Since the global recession hit the markets hard in 2009, this is the worst start to a US presidency. Although there are numerous causes for this decline, uncertainty on economic strategy and worries about inflation have contributed. In the past, it has often signaled impending volatility when the S&P 500 and Bitcoin decline simultaneously. The bear market of 2022, which saw prolonged losses, was the last time both markets fell precipitously at the same time. Not all dips, though, lead to protracted downturns. Some have led to a notable rebound, especially since the cryptocurrency\u2019s halving cycles. How is the market reacting to Trump\u2019s second term? Since his return, the S&P 500 has fallen 9%, marking the worst start to a presidency since 2009. Back then, a recession drove the drop. This time, uncertainty is in the driver\u2019s seat.

According to a CryptoQuant research, Bitcoin\u2019s price has tracked traditional markets, particularly the S&P 500. This pattern is not new. During the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the crypto and stocks fell together before recovering later that year. But IntoTheBlock analysts found that Bitcoin\u2019s relationship to the S&P 500 has dropped to essentially zero. This would suggest that, in line with long-term holders\u2019 pattern, BTC is starting to migrate outside of conventional finance. Should this decoupling continue, the movement in the price of Bitcoin might rely less on changes in the stock market. Historical Trends Suggest A Recovery According to CryptoQuant, prior data shows that Bitcoin has frequently rebounded following strong corrections. For example, in 2018, Bitcoin lost approximately 80% of its value before recovering in 2019. Similarly, following the 2020 crash, Bitcoin reached fresh all-time highs in 2021. Another statistic to keep an eye on is the Coinbase Premium Index, which measures the difference in Bitcoin prices between Coinbase and Binance. When this indicator goes negative and then returns to positive territory, it has typically indicated an impending price rebound. Related Reading: $931 Million BTC On The Move: Mt.

Some warn that Bitcoin\u2019s downturn could signal that the overall stock market rise is unsustainable. Tyler Richey, co-editor of Sevens Report Research, stated that Bitcoin\u2019s underperformance compared to its January peak could be a warning sign for equities.

Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn granted a temporary restraining order on March 12, requested by Bitcoin miner Consensus Colocation and systems owner Stone Ridge Ventures against Mawson Hosting, which provides hosting and colocation services for Bitcoin miners. The firms have been in disagreement over alleged unpaid fees, the terms of their agreement and Consensus\u2019 plan to relocate, allegedly leading to Mawson blocking the miner\u2019s personnel from accessing the site. The firms have also alleged Mawson has been operating the rigs since Feb. 28 for their own gain after preventing Consensus from entering the premises. Mawson, however, claims they are allowed to use the rigs under the terms of its agreement with Consensus, and they have the right of first refusal for its relocation plans. The Bitcoin miner has been seeking injunctive relief to regain control of their equipment and prevent Mawson from using them. As part of the March 12 order, Mawson is barred from using the hashrate from the miners and will no longer be allowed to restrict Consensus\u2019s digital and physical access to the rigs in the Midland, Pennsylvania, facility. A Delaware judge has granted a temporary restraining order barring Mawson Infrastructure Group from using the rigs at the Midland, Pennsylvania, facility. Source: Law360 The temporary restraining is in force until the matter can be heard in a preliminary injunction hearing. Mawson Infrastructure Group and Consensus Colocation did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph's request for comment. How the dispute began In a March 6 legal complaint, lawyers acting for Consensus accused Mawson of mining Bitcoin ( BTC ) with their rigs \u2014 valued at $30 million \u2014 since Feb. 28, generating daily profits of between $100,000 and $200,000 while blocking access to them both physically and through VPN access. Consensus and Stone Ridge signed a colocation agreement with Mawson in December 2023. They agreed to terminate the partnership by the end of March 2025, with a gradual reduction in capacity leading up to the deadline and a removal process scheduled to begin on March 3. Mawson argues that it was owed fees and electricity prepayments for February and March, and its colocation agreement gives it the right to redirect the hashrate of Consensus\u2019 miners and use the proceeds to replenish the deposit. Related: US-Canada tariff flip-flops have Bitcoin miners on their toes \u201cOn its face, it was operative only prior to April 1, 2024, and only in narrow circumstances relating to the replenishment of a deposit,\u201d lawyers acting for Consensus said in the suit. \u201cWhen Mawson began redirecting the hashrate on Feb. 28, the deposit was fully paid.

However, during the same period, its trading volume declined by 10%, indicating reduced participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, ADA is currently near a crucial support zone at $0.68 and $0.65, while $0.75 is acts as a strong resistance level, potentially hindering further rally attempts. Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if ADA breaches the 200 EMA and closes a daily candle above the $0.75 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 50% to reach the $1.13 mark.

While these established tokens dominate DeFi, trading and payments, this emerging contender is tackling real-world financial challenges in a way no other has. With a revolutionary approach to cross-border transactions, seamless crypto-to-fiat integration and explosive presale success, this altcoin is quickly gaining traction. Could this be the next major crypto to watch in 2025? Solana ETF Filing by Franklin Templeton Sparks Optimism for 2025 Solana has experienced its share of challenges in 2025. After a 14.2% weekly decline, it is trading around $122 , still far from its January peak. Even though other blockchain networks are active, Solana is one of the most vibrant platforms. It provides resources for DeFi implementations and NFT systems. The SEC regulatory authority shows increasing interest in Solana, as Franklin Templeton filed an ETF application , which Bloomberg predicts will receive approval before 2025. Several analysts predict a competing crypto project will replace Solana as the next disruptive blockchain alternative. SOL has solidified its position as a major blockchain for speed and scalability, but this emerging project brings different innovations through its disruptive financial model. The integration of blockchain into practical applications, particularly in payment systems, leads experts to believe that this project will supersede Solana, XRP and BNB. XRP Gains 3.72% As Market Optimism Sparks Short-Term Rally XRP remains one of the key players in the crypto space. Aftermarket fluctuations, the cryptocurrency\u2019s value has regained stability and reached $2.24 , a 3.72% increase. XRP showed swift price recovery following its previous dip below $2, reflecting positive market sentiment. The discussion of including XRP in the U.S. Digital Assets Stockpile leads analysts to believe that institutional demand will drive the asset price upwards. However, XRP\u2019s long-term direction remains unclear because regulatory ambiguity persists. Experiments in the evolving digital asset environment have traders doubting XRP\u2019s ability to stay in the top position. XRP maintains value from its established cross-border payment capabilities, although competition within this sector remains active. New blockchain projects have gained attention from investors because they offer swifter transactions, reduced fees and stronger institutional partnerships. BNB Sees High Liquidity But Fails To Tap Into The Remittance Market The price of Binance Coin (BNB) remains strong at around $576 , and daily trading volume remains over $2.4 billion. The Binance Smart Chain depends on BNB to power its DeFi application network, which provides quick and economically beneficial transactions. Deep market liquidity combined with institutional support enables BNB to stay at the top of its market sector. However, investor assessments of BNB\u2019s future growth potential started changing due to centralization issues and emerging competition from new blockchain platforms. BNB faces a key business opportunity because, despite its broad adoption, it has not yet penetrated the remittance market. Emerging blockchain projects provide alternative solutions that process transactions swifter while demanding diminished fees, despite Binance\u2019s established position in crypto trading. Rising regulatory oversight in the market has pushed investors to look for decentralized alternatives that do not need a single organization. With a new crypto contender gaining traction, analysts believe it could outshine top altcoins like BNB, Solana and even XRP. This rising star is disrupting traditional finance with real-world applications, leading many to believe it might be the next major player in the crypto industry. This New Crypto Could Outperform BNB And Reshape The Global Payments Industry Remittix (RTX) is emerging as a game-changer in the digital payments sector, with analysts predicting its potential to surpass giants like Solana, XRP and BNB. With its presale already generating massive traction at $0.0734 per token, Remittix is proving that real-world utility is what investors want. Unlike speculative assets that rely on hype, RTX focuses on bridging crypto with fiat seamlessly through its PayFi technology, enabling instant, low-cost global transactions. While blockchain leaders like Solana and BNB have established their dominance in DeFi and trading ecosystems, they haven\u2019t made significant strides in cross-border remittances. This is where Remittix disrupts the market. By eliminating excessive fees and long transaction times that plague traditional financial systems, RTX offers a practical and scalable alternative that could see mass adoption among businesses and individuals alike. Remittix Presale Surges As Experts See It As The Next Big Crypto Crypto experts are increasingly viewing Remittix as the next major player, not just for its financial inclusivity but for its potential to reshape the payments landscape. With a well-structured ecosystem and long-term growth strategy, RTX is on track to outperform legacy blockchain networks that fail to address real-world problems. As traditional banks and fintech firms explore blockchain-based remittance solutions, Remittix stands in a prime position to lead the charge potentially making one of the top altcoins of 2025.

On Thursday, Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, the Ranking Member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urging the department to halt all efforts to create the cryptocurrency reserve. Connolly warned that the initiative primarily serves to enrich Trump and his financial backers rather than benefiting the American public. \u201cSuch a reserve provides no discernible benefit to the American people but would significantly enrich the President and his donors,\u201d Connolly wrote. He also criticized the plan as reckless fiscal policy, arguing that it would artificially elevate Bitcoin over other currencies through social media hype and misallocate taxpayer funds. Connolly cited a Federal Reserve official who had reportedly dismissed the idea as \u201cthe dumbest\u201d proposal ever. NEW: RM @GerryConnolly sent a letter to @USTreasury Secretary Bessent urging the Department to cease all attempts to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, citing President Trump\u2019s glaring conflicts of interest. https://t.co/EK106k15oF \u2014 Oversight Committee Democrats (@OversightDems) March 13, 2025 Trump\u2019s Bitcoin Reserve Plan Taps Government\u2019s Crypto Holdings Trump\u2019s executive order, signed earlier this month, directs the federal government to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve , initially capitalized with about 200,000 Bitcoin already in the government\u2019s possession. Additionally, the order creates the US Digital Asset Stockpile, a separate entity designed to manage other forfeited cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano. While the Treasury may explore options for managing these digital assets, it will not actively expand the stockpile beyond assets seized through legal actions. Democrat Flags Trump\u2019s Stake in Crypto Ventures, Citing Conflict of Interest Further, Connolly\u2019s letter raises concerns over Trump\u2019s personal financial ties to the crypto industry, arguing that his business interests could influence federal policy in ways that serve him personally. The lawmaker specifically pointed to Trump\u2019s stake in World Liberty Financial , a crypto-based financial services company that aims to function as a digital asset bank. Trump, who maintains a significant ownership position in the venture, stands to profit immensely if federal policy bolsters cryptocurrency values, he said. Additionally, Connolly flagged Trump\u2019s involvement in $TRUMP, a meme-based cryptocurrency that has generated substantial revenue through trading fees. Reports suggest Trump-linked entities have already raked in as much as $100m from the token, which critics have described as his \u201cmost lucrative get-rich scheme yet.\u201d Beyond the ethical concerns, Connolly said that Trump has moved forward with the Bitcoin reserve plan without seeking congressional input or authorization. The lawmaker argued that such an initiative, which could have far-reaching implications for financial markets and federal monetary policy, demands a thorough legislative review. As pressure mounts, the Treasury Department has yet to publicly comment on whether it will proceed with Trump\u2019s controversial executive order.

Others have even suggested that the incident could benefit Hyperliquid\u2019s native HYPE token in the long run. Lessons Learned The loss occurred when a trader, identified by the wallet address 0xf3f4, opened a 175,000 ETH long position with 50 times leverage, valued at $340 million. After securing an unrealized profit of $8 million, the trader reportedly withdrew $17.09 million in margin, triggering an automatic liquidation of the remaining 160,000 ETH. Hyperliquid\u2019s HLP vault absorbed the position at $1,915 per ETH, putting it $4 million in the red. However, some analysts remain optimistic about the platform\u2019s future. Prominent DeFi commentator Aylo argued that stress tests, like the one Hyperliquid went through, are necessary to improve protocol design. \u201cIn this case, 1% hit on HLP was a very reasonable price to pay for the lesson learned and the apparent vulnerabilities discovered,\u201d he said. Additionally, he noted that while HYPE remains a risky investment given prevailing market conditions, its revenue stream and market share in the perps trading space make it undervalued. According to data from DefiLlama, the token\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 7.06, which, in Aylo\u2019s opinion, hints at a potential upside if Hyperliquid continues to grow. In the aftermath of the liquidation, HYPE lost 8.5% of its value but recovered soon after. Still, the broader market jitters seem to have caught up with it, dropping 11.4% from its price in the last 24 hours and just under 28% across the week. Ben Zhou Calls for More Risk Management Tools Bybit CEO Ben Zhou also weighed in on the event, highlighting the risks associated with high leverage on both centralized and decentralized exchanges. In a post on X, he explained how the protocol\u2019s liquidation engine took over the massive position and cushioned its impact by lowering leverage. The crypto executive, whose company was recently on the wrong end of the largest hack in the industry\u2019s history, suggested that DEXs must put in place stronger risk management mechanisms, including dynamic risk limits and market surveillance tools, to prevent similar occurrences in the future. The incident has prompted Hyperliquid to lower its maximum leverage for Bitcoin and Ethereum to 40x and 25x, respectively. He pointed out that HLP had been operating successfully for about two years with minimal issues and that the team has a track record of quick responses to challenges.
