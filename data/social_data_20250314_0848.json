        "text": "* Ethereum's transaction fees have significantly decreased to an average of $0.41 per transfer, the lowest in years. This reduction makes the network more accessible and encourages broader adoption, especially for developers and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.\n* The U.S. House of Representatives recently voted to repeal an IRS rule requiring decentralized finance brokers to report user transactions. This move could create a more favorable environment for Ethereum-based DeFi projects, potentially boosting demand for ETH.\n* The Ethereum Foundation has announced the appointment of Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz Sta\u0144czak as co-Executive Directors, effective March 17, 2025.\n* Ethereum developers are working on the Pectra upgrade, which includes improvements like enhanced smart contract functionality. A new testnet, Hooli, has been launched to finalize testing before deployment. If successful, the upgrade could go live on the main network by late April or early May 2025.\n* The Ethereum Foundation is facing a potential $900 million liquidation risk due to ETH locked in a MakerDAO vault. However, the foundation can mitigate this risk by adding collateral, if needed.\n* Ethereum's price has been on a downward trend, dropping below $2,000. Ethereum has strong support at $1,825, and traders are optimistic about a potential rally to $2,500. Positive market sentiment and increased leverage on long positions suggest a bullish reversal might be on the horizon.\n* $1.8 billion worth of Ethereum left exchanges last week. This is the largest outflow since December 2022, investors might be moving their ETH to private wallets for long-term holding.\n\nI remain optimistic, reduced supply on exchanges and potential regulatory approval for staking ETFs could act as catalysts for Ethereum's recovery!",

        "text": "I find it ironic that crypto was originally celebrated as anti-establishment and decentralized. Now, the entire market\u2019s price is dictated by what the US Fed Chair says at his next FOMC meeting. Literally letting a centralised entity dictate the entire fate of supposedly \u2018decentralised\u2019 assets. \n\nBefore you tell me I don\u2019t understand economics or that we need ideal macro conditions to trigger a rally, please stop. None of the previous cycles required perfect conditions to flourish. In 2021, we experienced a COVID recession with an economy in shambles. In 2017, the US entered quantitative tightening in September, right before a major altcoin rally. \n\nWe weren\u2019t checking every day for the next CPI report or unemployment data release. Do you know why? Because people believed crypto was worth HOLDING, not for short-term gains to dump it later, but because it could play a significant role in the future of finance and that it may hold great value in the future.\n\nThe narrative I see now is the exact opposite: almost no one believes in the technology or its potential for adoption. Everyone is just bagholding to make a quick profit and then dumping. What\u2019s even more amusing is that stock traders aren\u2019t as obsessed with these numbers as I\u2019ve seen crypto enthusiasts be lately \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: we have historically never had a better opportunity for full-scale adoption than right now. That\u2019s why I keep buying and ignore the noise. Crypto isn\u2019t going anywhere; it\u2019s only going to grow. The US now even holds a reserve for it, if you had told me years ago that ETH and altcoin prices would drop this low, I would\u2019ve called you crazy.\n\nAnd that\u2019s all the confirmation I need: the only reason we haven\u2019t seen an alt season or ETH soaring isn\u2019t due to a lack of fundamentals, but because people are being impatient and fearful.\n\nTo me, there\u2019s essentially no rational reason why we shouldn\u2019t see a parabolic run. This cycle is no different from the others; if anything, it\u2019s in a much stronger position than previous cycles. All you need to do is trust the process.\n\nI made the mistake of selling my bags too early in 2017, thinking it was just a fad, and then getting in too late in 2021. But that\u2019s part of the learning process. You see the same patterns over the years, people calling it a scam, insisting it\u2019s going to die, and then watching it come back stronger every time. Eventually, you really start to appreciate its cyclical nature and ignore all the noise. \n\nRant over.",

It\u2019s been a journey, and this Saturday, we\u2019ll be celebrating 44 women graduating from our [Bitcoin for Beginners](https://bitfiasi.org/bitcoin-for-beginners/) program, a big leap from the 16 in our first cohort! \n\nThe response has been incredible. More people are already reaching out to be part of the next cohort, and it\u2019s clear that the interest in Bitcoin among women in Ghana is growing fast.\n\nBeyond the classes, I\u2019ve also managed to take Bitcoin education to 4 senior high schools, running workshops to introduce students (especially young women) to Bitcoin, financial sovereignty, and digital assets. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and it\u2019s exciting to see more women eager to explore Bitcoin for savings, business, and long-term financial security.\n\n[This Saturday\u2019s event](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bitcoin-the-future-of-money-what-you-need-to-know-tickets-1271382020849) will have over 100 people attending, and it\u2019s already creating a buzz among those looking to start their Bitcoin journey.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear from this community, how do you think I can make this even better and also get support to reach a wider audience? Any ideas on improving outreach, structuring classes, or engaging more women in Bitcoin?\n\nWould appreciate any advice, and happy to share more about what\u2019s working so far!\n\n",

Yes I know, \"Keep stacking, keep doing what you can.\" \n\nPeople are asking this question, at least in my opinion, because they want to dream that they are just in time for complete financial freedom. \n\nOf course BTC will, if all trajectories are true it will definitely make life a little easier. Despite all the scarcity and inflation protection, I think people get caught up with multipliers. I'm guilty of it. The 4k Bitcoin days are long gone, but it gave those who invested a 25x gain, from 4k to 100K. If someone does own 0.1 BTC now that same multiplier would (assuming BTC had a current value of 100K) turn ~10K to 250K. \n\nThis is if Bitcoin is at 2.5mil per coin. For anyone dreaming of complete financial freedom, say randomly a 5mil goal, the price of 1 BTC would need to go up 500x to 50mil. \n\nSo my question again, those who own ~0.1 BTC, are they actually early enough for financial freedom?

        "text": "The largest Ethereum upgrade, in terms of EIPs included, is approaching despite some challenges faced on testnets.  \n  \nI've put together a concise thread covering the core changes that will be implemented during the Pectra upgrade.  \n  \nThis overview of the key EIPs should give you a clear understanding of the main concepts driving the upcoming changes to Ethereum.  \n  \nHere\u2019s what to expect in Ethereum Pectra  \ud83d\udc47\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/it6o8swg98oe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ed29b743b436c92820cf3d7c73efbce9485cbb4\n\n1/ **EIP-2537: Precompile for BLS12-381 curve operations**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: Alex Vlasov, Kelly Olson, Alex Stokes, Antonio Sanso\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 The current cryptographic tools in Ethereum, particularly the BN254 precompile, are not robust enough for applications that require enhanced security. The BLS12-381 curve provides stronger cryptographic features and is being more widely adopted across blockchain platforms for improved security.\n\n\n\n2/ **EIP-2935: Save historical block hashes in state**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2935](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2935)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: Vitalik Buterin, Tomasz Stanczak, Guillaume Ballet, Gajinder Singh, Tanishq Jasoria, Ignacio Hagopian, Jochem Brouwer, Sina Mahmoodi\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 Ethereum currently depends on clients for recent block hashes, which is not a future-proof approach. This proposal addresses the limitation by embedding block hashes in the state, enhancing accessibility and enabling features like extended proof validation and rollup interaction.\n\n\n\n3/ **EIP-6110: Supply validator deposits on chain**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6110](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6110)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: Mikhail Kalinin, Danny Ryan, Peter Davies\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 The current mechanism relies on the complex deposit voting process in the Consensus Layer. This proposal removes deposit voting from the Consensus Layer, shifting the responsibility for deposit inclusion and validation to the Execution Layer. The goal is to improve security, simplify client design, and reduce validator deposit processing delays\n\n\n\n4/ **EIP-7002: Execution layer triggerable exits**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7002](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7002)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: Danny Ryan, Mikhail Kalinin, Ansgar Dietrichs, Hsiao-Wei Wang, lightclients\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 Currently, validators need their active \"hot\" keys to initiate exits. The proposal addresses the restriction where only the active validator key could trigger withdrawals, ensuring that withdrawal credential holders have full control over their staked ETH securely and independently.\n\n\n\n5/ **EIP-7251: Increase the MAX\\_EFFECTIVE\\_BALANCE**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7251](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7251)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: Mike Neuder, Francesco, dapplion, Mikhail Kalinin, Aditya, Justin\u00a0Drake, lightclients\u00a0\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 Currently, validators are limited to 32 ETH, which forces large stakers to operate many redundant validators, and that increases network overhead and inefficiencies. This proposal would reduce the validator count, optimize resource use, and improve efficiency for both solo and large-scale stakers.\n\n\n\n6/ **EIP-7549: Move committee index outside Attestation**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7549](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7549)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: dapplion, Mikhail Kalinin\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 The current mechanism of attestations in Ethereum's Beacon Chain leads to increased computational and storage requirements for validators and ZK circuits.\n\nThe proposal's goal is to optimize Casper FFG (Friendly Finality Gadget) mechanisms that will enhance gas efficiency, scalability, and cryptographic verification.\n\n\n\n7/ **EIP-7623: Increase calldata cost**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7623](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7623)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: Toni Wahrst\u00e4tter, Vitalik Buterin\u00a0\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 Ethereum\u2019s calldata costs have remained unchanged since EIP-2028, leading to inefficiencies as rollups generate large, data-heavy blocks. This proposal adjusts calldata costs to reduce inefficiencies and align with EIP-4844's data availability changes.\n\n\n\n8/ **EIP-7685: General purpose execution layer requests**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7685](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7685)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: lightclients\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 Smart contract-controlled validators often rely on external intermediaries for administrative actions, introducing inefficiencies and risks. This proposal allows direct requests from smart contracts to the CL, streamlining operations and improving safety, scalability, and cross-layer communication for governance automation.\n\n\n\n9/ **EIP-7691: Blob throughput increase**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7691](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7691)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: Parithosh Jayanthi, Toni Wahrst\u00e4tter, Sam Calder-Mason, Andrew Davis, Ansgar Dietrichs\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 This proposal addresses current data availability limitations, offering a short-term scalability improvement for Layer 2 rollups while long-term solutions like peerDAS are being developed.\n\n\n\n10/ **EIP-7702: Set EOA account code**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: Vitalik Buterin, Sam Wilson, Ansgar Dietrichs, lightclients\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 EOAs are less programmable than smart contracts, limiting their efficiency and flexibility. This proposal introduces a mechanism to extend EOAs' functionality, improving gas optimization, security, and interoperability by bridging the gap between EOAs and contract accounts.\n\n\n\n11/ **EIP-7840: Add blob schedule to EL config files**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7840](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7840)\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Authors: lightclients\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 Currently, execution clients depend on blob configuration data for some features. Storing this data only in the consensus client leads to inefficiencies and extra API calls between clients for each block. This proposal improves performance by offloading the need for execution and consensus layers to perform excessive data handshakes.",

You want a customer to wait for possibly years(idk when the hell they're gonna integrate this shit) to get a 180$ refund? I provided them with a normal ETH address, asking them to send the money back via the normal ETH network and they've refused. \n\nDoes this seem strange to anyone else too or? I'll be filing a case with the UK FCA and the American FCEN.",

There was an estimate that it would take till at least March 28 to finalize. \n\n[Ether Guild](https://x.com/ethismoneyHQ/status/1899104142897086854) sounds like a great new community effort to promote Ethereum, focused on its value as money.  I like their graphic of Ethereum-promoting organizations in the [7th tweet](https://x.com/ethismoneyHQ/status/1899105464501326251) of that thread. The treasury is managed by, among others, Antony Sassano (The Daily Gwei) and Ryan Sean Adams (Bankless). Their first project is the [ETH is Money website](https://www.ethismoney.xyz/). \n\nThe Ethereum Foundation [added](https://blog.ethereum.org/en/2025/03/09/board-update) new Co-Executive Director Hsiao-Wei Wang to their board.  \n\nCoinbase [will be launching](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coming-soon-24/7-and-perpetual-style-futures-in-the-us) perpetual (no expiration date) Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts in the US. \n\nThe SEC is abandoning Gary Gensler's effort to expand the term \u201cexchange\u201d to include \u201ccommunications protocols,\u201d which would have picked up various protocols used with respect to crypto assets (see the \"Trading Venues\" section of [this speech](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-international-bankers-031025)).\n\nThe FDIC still isn't being transparent about Operation Chokepoint 2.0 (debanking of crypto), [according to](https://x.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1898246068795851001) Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal. \n\nIf you use the Safe wallet, there's a new tool, [SafeWatcher](https://x.com/0xmikko_eth/status/1897558518821237241), that could prevent losses like Bybit suffered recently. \n\nAnother new L2: [Movement](https://x.com/movementfdn/status/1899113385909944756), using the Move language that Facebook created for their abortive attempt to get into crypto.\n\n[Previous](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1j7yc5b/yesterday_in_ethereum_monday_march_10_2025/) Yesterday in Ethereum.",

I have only 20 days or less than 20 to learn and then to think something out of the box related to web 3 or Blockchains  . I am a complete beginner in Blockchain despite of this fact I want to participate as I have heard that the winner of previous hackIndia from our college was a complete beginner and he won the regional hackathon . Also when I asked him about the ideas  , he said me and my team did lot of discussions and brain storming to achieve success in that idea . But I think he is lying because one of my close friends said he copied the idea from GitHub .I am thinking to try to implement an already built project which I have found in GitHub . Is this a very bad idea ? I am doing this because I want to participate and it's not possible for me to think and learn something that I am not much aware of but still I am trying to gain knowledge rn about those things .

        "text": "We are thrilled to announce the launch of Shutter API, a threshold encryption service designed to simplify the integration of privacy features into decentralized applications (dApps)!\n\nShutter API is now live and already powering several early-stage applications while collaborating with partners to explore new use cases.\n\nUnlike the encrypted mempool on Gnosis Chain, OP Stack, or Ethereum L1, which addresses censorship and malicious MEV at the protocol level, Shutter API focuses on the application layer, enhancing encryption accessibility for dApp developers.\n\nThis service supports commit-reveal workflows, encrypted time-locked transactions, and improves transaction privacy for various applications, including gaming, governance, and finance.\n\nEncryption is essential for Web3 adoption as it protects sensitive information and fosters fair markets. Shutter API ensures temporary privacy, allowing information to be disclosed at the right moment\u2014like a sealed envelope that only opens under specific conditions.\n\nKey use cases include:\n\n- Governance & Voting\n- Sealed-Bid Auctions\n- Fair Gaming\n- Smart Account Encryption\n- Time-Locked Gifts\n\n**How It Works:**\n\n1. **Register an Identity**\n2. **Encrypt Data**\n3. **Submit Action**\n4. **Decrypt at the Right Time**\n\nShutter API simplifies encryption integration, requiring no cryptographic expertise and minimizing trust. This is just the beginning, with more applications in development. Join our livestream tomorrow to see how encryption is shaping the future of Web3!\n\nLearn more at the Shutter Blog: [https://blog.shutter.network/introducing-shutter-api-threshold-encryption-service/](https://blog.shutter.network/introducing-shutter-api-threshold-encryption-service/)",
